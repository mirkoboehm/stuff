                  serves a as a means to improve overall quality of
                  life through the economies of scale gained from the
                  pervasive adoption of technical solutions. It
                  enables competition by facilitating interoperability
                  between products of different vendors. The wider
                  open source community develops free and open source
                  software (FOSS) in a global upstream/downstream
                  model that similarly benefits society as a public
                  good. FOSS and standards setting organizations
                  (SSOs) are both instruments causing standardizing
                  effects. Innovators and policy-makers assume that a
                  mutually beneficial collaboration between them is
                  desirable. However, their exact relationship is not
                  fully understood, especially when and how FOSS and
                  SSOs complement each other, or displace each other
                  as competitors. To be able to compare FOSS and SSOs,
                  our study develops a phase model of standardization
                  that is applicable to both approaches, and applies
                  this model to compare the strengths and weaknesses
                  of FOSS and SSOs against common opportunities and
                  threats in the ICT sector. Based on qualitative
                  expert interviews with FOSS and SSO representatives,
                  the synthesis of the separate results support
                  conclusions from a product, a process and a societal
                  perspective. The study identifies
                  &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;cost of change&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;
                  as a key determinant for the efficacy of each
                  approach. It concludes that FOSS and SSOs create
                  complementary products, compete for efficiency of
                  the standardization process, and are both
                  independent and complementary standardization
                  instruments available to industry and influenceable
                  by policy-makers. The paper closes with a discussion
                  of possible implications relevant to businesses, the
                  wider open source community, SSOs and
                  policy-makers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={7},
