It was commissioned by the European Commission’s DG CONNECT. It is estimated that companies located in the EU invested around €1 billion in OSS in 2018, which resulted in an impact on the European economy of between €65 and €95 billion. The analysis estimates a cost-benefit ratio of above 1:4 and predicts that an increase of 10% of OSS contributions would annually generate an additional 0.4% to 0.6% GDP as well as more than 600 additional ICT start-ups in the EU. Case studies reveal that by procuring OSS instead of proprietary software, the public sector could reduce the total cost of ownership, avoid vendor lock-in and thus increase its digital autonomy. The study also contains an analysis of existing public policy actions in Europe and around the world. The scale of Europe’s institutional capacity related to OSS, however, is disproportionately smaller than the scale of the value created by OSS. The study therefore gives a number of specific public policy recommendations aimed at achieving a digitally autonomous public sector, open R&amp;amp;D enabling European growth and a digitised and internally competitive industry.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The report has been developed in the framework of the 2017
Communication of the European Commission ‘Setting out the EU approach
to Standard Essential Patents’ (COM(2017) 712 final). In this
Communication there is a direct commitment that &amp;lsquo;The Commission will
work with stakeholders, open source communities and SDOs for
successful interaction between open source and standardisation, by
means of studies and analyses&amp;rsquo;. Standards and open source development
are both processes widely adopted in the ICT industry to develop
innovative technologies and drive their adoption in the
market. Innovators and policy makers assume that a closer
collaboration between standards and open source software development
would be mutually beneficial. The interaction between the two is
however not yet fully understood, especially with regard to how the
intellectual property regimes applied by these organisations influence
their ability and motivation to cooperate. This study provides a
comprehensive analysis of the interaction between standard development
organisations (SDOs) and open source software (OSS) communities. The
analysis is based on 20 case studies, a survey of stakeholders
involved in SDOs and OSS communities, an expert workshop, and a
comprehensive review of the literature.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
