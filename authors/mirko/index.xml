&lt;a href="https://github.com/mirkoboehm/shelldoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shelldoc&lt;/a> version 0.91, the
second release candidate on the road to 1.0. This release focuses on
code quality and test coverage. &lt;code>shelldoc version&lt;/code> now reports the
correct version even when installed via &lt;code>go install&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-new-in-091">What&amp;rsquo;s new in 0.91?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This release emphasizes stability and maintainability:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Expanded test coverage&lt;/strong> across all major components including CLI
commands, tokenizer, and JUnit XML output generation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved API documentation&lt;/strong> with godoc comments added to all
exported functions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Code quality improvements&lt;/strong> fixing non-idiomatic boolean
comparisons and other style issues&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Removed experimental regex matching&lt;/strong> which was incomplete and not
ready for production use&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-focus-on-tests-and-code-quality">Why focus on tests and code quality?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Comprehensive test coverage boosts confidence that future changes
won&amp;rsquo;t introduce regressions. Once shelldoc reaches 1.0, development
will change to an on-demand release model: Every bug fix will trigger
a patch release. Every new feature will trigger a minor
release. Mirko&amp;rsquo;s whims will decide when a major release is made
(possibly never). Clean, idiomatic code simply makes the project more
maintainable and welcoming to contributors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The incomplete regex matching was removed because it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether
it&amp;rsquo;s needed. If you are sad to see it go, feel free to submit a feature
request by creating a GitHub issue. Or a pull request, of course.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/mirkoboehm/shelldoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shelldoc&lt;/a> with version 0.90.
After a maintenance hiatus, I have taken over active maintenance of
shelldoc again in 2026. This release marks the first of three planned
release candidates on the road to a stable 1.0 version.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-shelldoc">What is shelldoc?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>shelldoc tests Unix shell commands embedded in Markdown
documentation. It parses Markdown files, identifies code blocks
containing shell commands, executes them, and verifies that the output
matches the documented expectations. This ensures that your
documentation examples remain accurate and up-to-date as your software
evolves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a simple example in your README:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ echo Hello
Hello
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>shelldoc will execute &lt;code>echo Hello&lt;/code> and verify that the output matches
&amp;ldquo;Hello&amp;rdquo;. If documentation and reality drift apart, shelldoc will catch
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Documentation rot is a common problem in software projects. Examples
that worked when written become outdated as APIs change, dependencies
evolve, or behavior is modified. Users following outdated instructions
encounter errors, leading to frustration and support burden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By integrating shelldoc into your CI pipeline, every pull request
automatically validates that documented shell commands still work as
described. The tool produces JUnit XML output that integrates with
common CI systems, providing visual test reports for documentation
accuracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-new-in-090">What&amp;rsquo;s new in 0.90?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This release focuses on modernization and stability:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bug fixes and security improvements&lt;/strong> addressing issues
accumulated during the maintenance hiatus&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Modernized to Go 1.21&lt;/strong> with updated dependencies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>GitHub Actions CI&lt;/strong> with visual test result reports&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved documentation&lt;/strong> including security considerations and
limitations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Installing shelldoc is straightforward with Go:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">go install github.com/mirkoboehm/shelldoc/cmd/shelldoc@v0.90
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="road-to-10">Road to 1.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Version 0.90 is the first of three release candidates planned before
the stable 1.0 release. I plan bi-weekly releases until stable,
incorporating feedback and addressing issues discovered during testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Testing and experimentation are encouraged. If you maintain
documentation with shell examples, I would appreciate feedback on how
shelldoc works for your use case. Contributions and pull requests are
welcome at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mirkoboehm/shelldoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

how to use or build software. Such documentation often contains shell
commands demonstrating how to build or run it. To ensure documentation
remains accurate and up-to-date, it should be automatically
tested. shelldoc tests Unix shell commands in Markdown files and
reports the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>shelldoc parses Markdown files, identifies code blocks containing shell

Congress&lt;/a>
took place in Brussels on 16 September 2025. This annual gathering
brings together code-hosting open source foundations and partners to
align on critical issues facing the ecosystem. After the Linux
Foundation created Open Source Congress in 2023, each year a different
organization has signed up as the host. I would like to thank the
Eclipse Foundation for agreeing to be the host this year. The event
focused on four key topics: open source in a multi-polar world,
cybersecurity, sustainability, and regulation and public policy. The
primary value of such gatherings lies in alignment and exchange rather
than concrete actions. Since Open Source Congress operates under
Chatham House rules and is less accessible than typical open source
events, sharing insights from the discussions serves the wider
community. Below are personal observations from the four panels.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="panel-1---open-source-in-a-multi-polar-world">Panel 1 - Open Source in a Multi-Polar World&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The open source ecosystem was multi-polar from its inception. Key open
source innovations originate from various regions: Ruby from
Japan, Linux and Python from Europe, the GNU Project from the US. The
US tech industry was quicker to realize open source technologies as
a growth driver, allowing US business interests to overlay this
narrative today. However, nothing is inherently polarizing in how the
open source ecosystem works. It serves as both
creative destruction and resilience mechanism, undermining
traditional control structures while remaining largely
unregulable. Cultural and language barriers continue to shape
how and where contributors collaborate, making truly global
collaboration a key challenge. There is optimism
that AI will provide instant translation mechanisms to bridge
such divides. Maintaining arms-length distance from policy making
remains essential to preserve open source&amp;rsquo;s organic governance. At the same
time, regulation will inevitably affect the
ecosystem&amp;rsquo;s global dynamics. The EU Cyber Resilience Act is
the first law explicitly shaping stakeholder roles.
While progress has been made in building capacity and
expertise for open source foundations to engage in policy debates
when necessary, much work remains.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="panel-2---cybersecurity-influencing-best-practices-and-standards">Panel 2 - Cybersecurity: Influencing Best Practices and Standards&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A global race to define cybersecurity standards creates a
maze of regulation across international markets. While this
challenges global manufacturers, open source communities face few
concrete regulatory obligations. However, to enable global adoption of their
releases, they are strongly incentivized to support
downstream users with documentation and sound cybersecurity
practices. Creating an environment conducive to smooth
upstream-downstream collaboration requires open source foundations to
engage in relevant standards development processes that define
implementation details of cybersecurity regulation. This
remains difficult, as most stewards lack both funding and
subject matter expertise for standards development.
The panel revealed tensions between traditional open source
collaboration and emerging bureaucratic frameworks at organizations
like the
&lt;a href="https://unite.un.org/en/news/sixteen-organizations-endorse-un-open-source-principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://www.digitalpublicgoods.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DPGA&lt;/a>, warning that OSS
risks losing its core strengths when bent to external rules. The
discussion emphasized that effective policy engagement should
facilitate organic collaboration and create market-driven incentives
rather than impose rigid bureaucratic structures. Initiatives like
the Linux Foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://alpha-omega.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha-Omega&lt;/a> serve as
effective funding instruments that align with open source
principles. In recent years, public initiatives like the German
&lt;a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sovereign Tech Agency&lt;/a> increasingly
support under-maintained projects. Under guidance from &lt;a href="https://openforumeurope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Forum
Europe&lt;/a>, a &lt;a href="https://eu-stf.openforumeurope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feasibility
study&lt;/a> has been submitted to the
EU to elevate such activities to the European level with a larger
budget.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="panel-3---sustainability-and-the-open-ecosystem">Panel 3 - Sustainability and the Open Ecosystem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The sustainability of the open source development model is hotly
debated. The underlying issue appears to be a mix of insufficient funding and a
fundamental &amp;ldquo;matchmaking problem&amp;rdquo; of allocating available funds to
specific projects and contributors efficiently. While
the myth that open source is the unpaid labor of love of hobbyist
maintainers still percolates, the 2024 &lt;a href="https://opensourcefundingsurvey2024.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Software Funding
Survey&lt;/a> shows that 86% of
contribution value comes from employee labor. This study raises challenging
questions. On one hand, what will be the effect of 50m€ public funding
initiatives if $7.7B is invested by private industry
annually? On the other hand, if more funding becomes available, how
will it be distributed? Grant making will profoundly impact
the viability of individual projects, raising concerns about
public sector actors&amp;rsquo; ability to effectively disperse
sovereign-tech-fund-like funds where they are needed most, rather
than to favored champions or consultancies specializing in grant
acquisition. However, such initiatives will likely support
ecosystem diversity and grassroots initiatives, which may
be a benefit worth the cost.
Some funding programs focus on maintenance or security, creating
a risk of fragmenting development work by separating improvement,
maintenance, and security responsibilities. Since implementing new
features is always most fascinating, the impression that maintenance
and cybersecurity are somebody else&amp;rsquo;s problem must be avoided.
Emerging models favor market-driven approaches like
the EU CRA, which creates business incentives for maintenance work and
eliminates freeloading, potentially contributing more to
open source sustainability than public spending programs that struggle
with coordination and measurement challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="panel-4---regulation-and-public-policy">Panel 4 - Regulation and Public Policy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The final session was essentially a moderated Q&amp;amp;A round. A cluster of
questions evolved around how external forces now influencing the open
source world will reshape open collaboration dynamics. The
release-early-release-often, show-me-the-code mentality drives
experimentation and a somewhat Darwinian trial-and-error approach to
identifying promising projects. Voluntary participation ensures that
projects receive attention according to their value to the
community. Interestingly, funding programs based on selective awards
are expected to bias these mechanisms more than market access
regulation. Future research is needed to verify this expectation.
However, regulatory approaches will fundamentally reshape the
ecosystem by influencing adoption criteria for components, driving
consolidation of fragmented libraries into fewer, more maintainable
packages and addressing collective action problems around
responsibility and decision-making in policy advocacy. This will
affect different communities differently, depending on factors like the
granularity and maintainer base of package repositories. However, there
is a prevailing assumption that smaller communities and their
stewards will face greater challenges than larger ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Open Source Congress represents more than an annual conference. It
embodies the vision of ongoing collaboration among open source
foundations to address the ecosystem&amp;rsquo;s evolving challenges. The
facilitation of coordination between stewards serves at
least two purposes: bridging cultural and language divides that have
historically fragmented global collaboration, and building the
collective capacity needed to engage effectively with increasingly
complex regulatory environments. While the tension between preserving
open source&amp;rsquo;s creative autonomy and meeting external compliance
requirements will continue to influence the ecosystem&amp;rsquo;s future, the
foundation community&amp;rsquo;s growing expertise in policy advocacy and
standards development positions it increasingly better to navigate
these challenges. The conversations at this year&amp;rsquo;s Congress suggest
that open source&amp;rsquo;s greatest strength, its ability to adapt and evolve
organically, will ultimately enable it to thrive within, rather than
despite, the new regulatory landscape.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pathways to Cybersecurity: Best Practices in Open Source</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/pathways-to-cybersecurity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/pathways-to-cybersecurity/</guid><description>&lt;p>The European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) presents a
watershed moment for the open source ecosystem, imposing
rigorous cybersecurity requirements on products with digital
elements (PDEs) commercialized in the EU. While the regulation
will not fully apply until December 2027, with certain provisions
taking effect earlier, the stakes are enormous—penalties
reaching €15 million or 2.5% of global annual turnover for non-compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The regulation’s impact extends beyond documentation and
vulnerability reporting. It fundamentally alters the relationship
between upstream open source projects and downstream commercial
adopters, demanding greater collaboration for sustainable
security maintenance. Neither manufacturers nor stewards
can meet CRA requirements in isolation—manufacturers must
conduct due diligence when integrating open source components,
while stewards must implement and document cybersecurity
policies that facilitate secure development.
The Linux Foundation’s analysis of three flagship projects—Civil
Infrastructure Platform (CIP), Yocto Project, and Zephyr Project—reveals
both the readiness and challenges facing open
source software stewards under the new regulatory framework.
The CRA introduces a novel distinction between commercial
manufacturers who bear primary responsibility for product
compliance, and open source software stewards who develop
and maintain open source software without monetization. This
acknowledges the reality that open source components often
constitute up to 96% of modern software while respecting the
fundamental openness of the development model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>World of Open Source: Open Source Maturity in Europe</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/oss-europe-2024/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/oss-europe-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past three years, LF Research has conducted a study on the

&lt;p>Non-commercial FOSS development is excluded from the scope of the EU
Cyber Resilience Act, and so are individual volunteer
developers. Businesses are not. But where is the line between an
incorporated FOSS community and an open source business? Depending on
the answer, making FOSS releases comes with significant obligations
like implementing maintenance and vulnerability reporting processes,
self or third party certifications or providing patches for the 5
years or more lifecycle of the product. This will impact the viability
of some FOSS development models like that of part-time maintainers
supported by donations, or business-sponsored communities. The
governance setup of FOSS projects may have to be sharpened to match
the roles required in the law. The presentation will break down the
obligations, when and how they apply and what actions communities can
take to handle them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Futures of innovation and intellectual property regulation in 2040</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/eu-2024-futures-of-innovation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/eu-2024-futures-of-innovation/</guid><description>

&lt;p>As open source software becomes the foundation to build digital
products, to run the backbones of ICT infrastructure and to ensure
digital sovereignty and cyber resilience, both the technology as well
as the communities that develop it inevitably move into the focus of
regulators. The European Union is advancing a number of policy
initiatives that regulate liability, cyber security, data handling and
AI applications in digital products, among others. This is a challenge
for the still quite decentralised and globally operating open source
community. How could the open source community participate in
legislative processes, and what may be the potential impacts of the
upcoming regulation on the open source development process and

centre of most of my professional life. Three years ago, I accepted an
offer from MBition, the Mercedes-Benz infotainment development
subsidiary, to develop their open source strategy and drive horizontal
collaboration on the infotainment functionality in the automotive
industry. Since then I have been on an amazing development journey
culminating in the introduction of the new &lt;a href="https://media.mercedes-benz.com/e-class2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes-Benz E
class&lt;/a>, the first model
to feature MBition&amp;rsquo;s next generation infotainment software. While
delivering such an amazing product to market was exhilarating, I have
always found a different joy from working directly in the open source
community. As of today I am excited to announce I am going to be
focusing on community development at &lt;a href="https://linuxfoundation.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux Foundation
Europe&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Europe has a special place in the open source community. It is home to
projects like LibreOffice, KDE, as well as to CERN where the web was
invented. Linux started in Scandinavia. But just as importantly, and
besides ecosystem-defining projects like that, there is a culture of
collaboration and community. &lt;a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software
Heritage&lt;/a> is a great example of
looking beyond &amp;ldquo;scratching your own itch&amp;rdquo; at how software shapes
society. This sense of finding common ground and building community
around it is at the heart of the European project for the last
decades. At Linux Foundation Europe, I want to contribute to the open
source software component of this larger effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concretely, I expect there will be three main stakeholders: industry,
the volunteer open source community and the public sector. All three
share a common interest in innovative, stable, secure open source
projects, especially when they get adopted as software infrastructure
components. However, the three groups also speak different languages
and historically have trouble collaborating. This can be overcome, for
example, by hosting projects like
&lt;a href="https://openwallet.foundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWallet&lt;/a> that bring regulators and
industry together, but also tackle essential software freedom and
digital sovereignty concerns. Open Source is most successful when it
boils down to &amp;ldquo;show me the code&amp;rdquo; and facilitating contributions from
all interested parties. Identifying prospects for such projects and
building the collaboration between all stakeholders will be the
essence of my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, there is a lot of attention on regulatory initiatives that
affect the open source community, like the &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyber Resilience Act
(CRA)&lt;/a>
or the upcoming &lt;a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU AI
act&lt;/a>. Working with the European
Commision regulators to ensure that those initiatives support the open
source projects that are the key innovation drivers in those areas
instead of hindering them is an absolute top priority. However, the
bigger picture of facilitating and growing projects that span
industry, volunteer community and European governments should take
centre stage in the longer term. I am looking forward to working on
this European-scale challenge and to the collaboration with all the
involved contributors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Economics of Open Source</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/oup-economics-of-open-source/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/oup-economics-of-open-source/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Open Source Software in Standard Setting: The Role of Intellectual Property Right Regimes</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/oup-open-source-standards/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/oup-open-source-standards/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/eu-impact-of-open-source/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/eu-impact-of-open-source/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/project/ec-oss-impact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/project/ec-oss-impact/</guid><description>&lt;p>This study analyses the economic impact of Open Source Software (OSS) and Hardware (OSH) on the European economy. It was commissioned by the European Commission’s DG CONNECT. It is estimated that companies located in the EU invested around €1 billion in OSS in 2018, which resulted in an impact on the European economy of between €65 and €95 billion. The analysis estimates a cost-benefit ratio of above 1:4 and predicts that an increase of 10% of OSS contributions would annually generate an additional 0.4% to 0.6% GDP as well as more than 600 additional ICT start-ups in the EU. Case studies reveal that by procuring OSS instead of proprietary software, the public sector could reduce the total cost of ownership, avoid vendor lock-in and thus increase its digital autonomy. The study also contains an analysis of existing public policy actions in Europe and around the world. The scale of Europe’s institutional capacity related to OSS, however, is disproportionately smaller than the scale of the value created by OSS. The study therefore gives a number of specific public policy recommendations aimed at achieving a digitally autonomous public sector, open R&amp;amp;D enabling European growth and a digitised and internally competitive industry.&lt;/p>

Small conversations via
video call are a regular part of remote work. In times of restricted
travel and polluted air, this is excellent. It also works pretty well
for two or three people. With 6, it gets difficult to manage who
speaks. Above ten, things get tricky both from a technical as well as
a social perspective.
We have all been in this call
where there was an echo that blew everybody&amp;rsquo;s ears off, except for
that one person that did not hear it (it was them). I have collected a
few technical tips and practises over time that may help make video
conferences easier and more enjoyable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In situations with a small number of participants, there will be few
technical issues. The technology for video conferencing handles such
setups quite well. Group size is also a social matter &amp;ndash; it is easy to
ask your buddy in the one-to-one to hang on a second while you silence
the phone. In a call with 20 people, it is rude to have the phone ring
in the first place. So let&amp;rsquo;s be spoiled brats here and look at the
finer things in demanding situations:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="basics">Basics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are two main contributors to enjoyable video conferencing,
network and media, as in audio and video. Both start to act up with
more participants because network use increases with the number of
participants and audio adds up as well from multiple sources. Let&amp;rsquo;s
break it down.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="networking">Networking&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Choppy audio or hanging video often indicate issues with networking
(or too much load on the computer, but that is less common
today). Network issues can be related to bandwidth, latency and
stability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regarding &lt;em>bandwidth&lt;/em>, a good audio stream requires a couple of KB per
second, while a good video stream requires 100s of KB to tens of MBs
per second. For video connections, the requirements add up with the
number of participants and quickly reach the limits of slower internet
connections. If the choppiness reduces when video is turned off, it
indicates an issue with network bandwith. Bandwidth has a weakest link
problem, it is limited by the slowest element in the connection between
the participants. For example, if a computer is tethered to the
internet connection of a mobile phone, the wifi connection between the
computer and the phone may look faster than the internet connection
speed of the phone which then becomes the bottleneck.
Most commonly, bandwidth at the internet provider
is quite reliable and fast, so that the limits should be located
between the internet access point and the computer.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For wifi connections, make sure there is plenty of reserve bandwidth
above that constantly needed for conferencing. Other applications
also use bandwidth. Loading a larger web page can be demonstrated to
temporarily cause choppy video in a conference. As a rule of thumb,
wifi should be at least at 100MB per second, ideally way
higher. Keep in mind that wifi speed drops as the distance to the
access point increases. Moving around the house or cafe may affect
the available bandwidth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Phone internet connections are suitable for one-to-ones. For more
participants, they can quickly exhaust network bandwidth and may
rack up volume-based data fees. They also make everybody else&amp;rsquo;s
experience miserable because the camera usually zooms in on your
nose hair.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wired network connections are great because they do not degrade with
distance and provide fast, consistent speed. One check for
potential wifi issues is to temporarily connect the computer to the
internet access point using a network cable and see if the
conference quality improves.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Latency&lt;/em>, or network delay, is also a potential problem. It is
usually low enough for wifi and wired internet connections and can be
low to horrendous on mobile. There is not much that can be done about
it from the users side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Network &lt;em>stability&lt;/em> (basically all aspects in how your network
connection quality may change while the conference is in progress) can
become a real nuisance. Especially for longer video conferences
like the 8-hour one I just attended a lot of disturbances can
happen. For example, a badly shielded vacuum cleaner may interfere
with wireless network. Murphy&amp;rsquo;s law has it that your neighbour will
always start vacuuming 10 minutes into the call. Another interference
may be network traffic by other users. Wifi bandwidth is shared and
can be eaten up if family members create a lot of other
traffic. Reducing the Netflix subscription to only one stream may help
here :-) In general, relying on bandwidth to be constantly available
is a bit risky. Also here, using a wired connection circumvents some
of the problems, since it (usually) does not share bandwidth with
other computers on the local network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a good rule of thumb, more bandwidth (a faster internet connection)
is always better, and wired network beats everything in terms of
consistent quality and stability. Go wired or sit close to the wifi
access point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="video">Video&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Video depends mostly on hardware and system load, provided the
computer can handle processing the video data. In most
cases, if video quality degrades, it is not because of hardware
issues, but because the software decides the computer or the network
cannot handle a higher resolution and switches to a lower
one. Consider shutting down unnecessary programs, especially if you
are low on memory. The task manager or activity monitor display memory
and processor usage and indicate if the computer is
overloaded. High-quality video uses exponentially more computing power
and bandwidth depending on the resolution, so reducing video quality
along the usual steps (ultra-&amp;gt;HD-&amp;gt;SD-&amp;gt;whateveritiscalled) will result
in much lower requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="audio">Audio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Audio is often the most difficult issue because it usually works just fine
in test situations and then causes problems during the
conference. Key issues are feedback, background noise and foreground
noise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Audio feedback loops&lt;/em> are the worst. They range from a simple
annoying echo to techno-music-like loops that get increasingly
louder. This is caused by the microphone picking up the output of the
speakers, retransmitting it to the audience so that it is played by
the speakers again with a delay and this way
causing a never-ending loop. It gets louder if the volume of the next
round is higher than before and softer if it is lower. It can be
anything from a decreasing echo to a cacophony.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This also indicates the remedy to feedback: In a conference settings
where the participants all attend remotely, the audio of the
conference should &lt;em>never&lt;/em> come from speakers so that the microphone
can pick it up. Use a headset instead. Always. If you take one thing
away from this guide, it should be to always use a headset for video
conferencing with groups. Use in-ears if you don&amp;rsquo;t like headphone
hair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conferencing software has audio echo cancellation (feedback
suppression) built in. It works ok, but not in all
situations. Sometimes it slips in the middle of a call just for a
second, but long enough for you to hear yourself speak with some delay
or to deafen the whole audience. Better not to rely on it - keep it
simple and use a headset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Foreground noise&lt;/em> is one thing that throws off software echo
cancellation at times. Foreground noise is ambient sound that
originates from close to or the casing of the microphone. Ideally the
only foreground noise should be what you say. However, the built-in
microphones is located within to the computer and picks up typing on
the keyboard or anything else your hands do very loudly. Such noises
appear a lot louder to the audience than to you because they are
partially filtered by our hearing. Another problem with the built-in
microphone being integrated in the computer case is that it picks up
typing, rattling and anything physical going on on the desk the
computer sits on. The remedy to this is the same as to echo &amp;ndash; use a
headset that also has a built-in microphone. This separates the
microphone from the computer casing and locates it much closer to your
mouth and further away from the keyboard. So again &amp;ndash; use a headset,
now with a microphone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Background noise&lt;/em> is caused by whatever happens in your environment
during the call. Your phone notifications, people walking by or
talking to each other, clocks ticking, all of this will be picked up and
transmitted to the audience. And it adds up if their are many. It is a
matter of courtesie as well to avoid that as much as possible. There
are three remedies: Mute yourself when you are not talking. Reduce
background noise by picking a quiet room or moving further away from
the sources. Keep your microphone close to your mouth (headset&amp;hellip;) so
that the microphone volume can be lowered as much as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If the calls are important, consider doing a trial run where you
participate on the other end. Try out typing, talking to other people
in the room, shuffling things on the desk and all the other things
that could go wrong. Especially if the setup is going to be used
often, it is worth spending time to make sure it works really well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that it may appear on &lt;em>your end&lt;/em> that the built-in
speakers and microphone work just fine but it may make the experience
for everybody else on the call miserable with your voice being choppy
and overlaid by typing noises.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For indoor use, gamer headsets offer a great combination of
comfortable, high-quality headphones with good microphones that can be
worn for a few hours without becoming annoying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, the choice of specific video conferencing tool does not
matter that much. Modern web or app based systems work pretty much the
same, as long as the discussed technical aspects are taken care
of.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To sum up, there are four key steps towards better video
conferencing with larger groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use a headset with a microphone close, but not too close to your
mouth. Avoid using the built-in speakers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a wired network connection or ensure a very good connection to
the wifi network. Avoid mobile networks for this use case.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a headset (or stand-alone) microphone and avoid the built-in
microphone of the computer to reduce foreground noise.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure a quiet environment and mute yourself when not speaking.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Finally, it will be helpful to consider online meeting etiquette. If
you participate in a call, make time for it. Put your phone on
do-not-disturb during the call and focus your attention on what is
being discussed. Combined with a solid technical setup, this should
make video conferences a lot more enjoyable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Relationship Between Open Source Software and Standard Setting</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/ec-jrc-oss-sdo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/ec-jrc-oss-sdo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This publication is a Science for Policy report by the Joint Research

&lt;p>The report has been developed in the framework of the 2017
Communication of the European Commission ‘Setting out the EU approach
to Standard Essential Patents’ (COM(2017) 712 final). In this
Communication there is a direct commitment that &amp;lsquo;The Commission will
work with stakeholders, open source communities and SDOs for
successful interaction between open source and standardisation, by
means of studies and analyses&amp;rsquo;. Standards and open source development
are both processes widely adopted in the ICT industry to develop
innovative technologies and drive their adoption in the
market. Innovators and policy makers assume that a closer
collaboration between standards and open source software development
would be mutually beneficial. The interaction between the two is
however not yet fully understood, especially with regard to how the
intellectual property regimes applied by these organisations influence
their ability and motivation to cooperate. This study provides a
comprehensive analysis of the interaction between standard development
organisations (SDOs) and open source software (OSS) communities. The
analysis is based on 20 case studies, a survey of stakeholders
involved in SDOs and OSS communities, an expert workshop, and a
comprehensive review of the literature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The emergence of governance norms in volunteer-driven open source communities</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/fossgovernance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/fossgovernance/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a reminiscence to the early times of free software collaboration,

Academy&lt;/a>
held its second 2019 workshop in Brussels this week. OpenForum Academy
is a European-based independent think tank which explains the merits
of openness in computing to policy makers, industry and communities across
Europe. This workshop series aims at being a forum for practitioners,
academics and policy makers to collaborate on various topics of
openness and freedom. It is organized by &lt;a href="http://www.openforumeurope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenForum
Europe&lt;/a>, enabling it to bridge
between the abstract academic world and policy discussions at
the European Commissions. We set out to explore focus topics to answer
current challenges to openness that the academy will develop insights
and recommendations for. These topics will shape the work of
OpenForum Academy for the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshop was opened by a series of input presentations. One of
those was on &amp;ldquo;Addressing lock-in challenges through the use of open

OpenForum Europe champions openness in Europe, a topic that has

&lt;h2 id="exploring-modern-dimensions-of-openness">Exploring modern dimensions of openness&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Personally, I am primarily interested in Open Source aspects. However,
there are other dimensions of openness that cover different processes
and results. There is still a discussion of what an &lt;em>open standard&lt;/em>
is. &lt;em>Open hardware&lt;/em> works quite differently to software, because the
open specifications eventually have to be turned into physical
goods. Access to data is an angle independent from software,
specifications and hardware, and most software is made useful by the data
sets it processes. We want more scientific articles to be
available under &lt;em>open access&lt;/em> licenses, especially when they are
creating with public funding. The list of topics related to openness
is probably never-ending. Eventually, the following aspects emerged
as the currently most interesting ones:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="openness-and-the-cloud">Openness and the Cloud&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>How the transition of ICT to cloud and edge services changes the
importance of FOSS and data unsurprisingly sparked a heated debate
during the workshop. Is software freedom threatened by the rise of
cloud computing because software modifications are not required to be
shared? How can vendor lock-in and a lack of choice be overcome? Very
importantly, what is new about cloud that is different to before
(hint: it may be less than we think)? How can consumer interests be
protected and a healthy business ecosystem promoted? How can
regulation help and where does regulation overreach (think
surveillance or user profiling)? Many of these questions are about
finding the right balance, or identifying the justified intrusions
into the user&amp;rsquo;s rights to confidentiality and privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-source-as-civil-ict-infrastructure">Open Source as Civil ICT Infrastructure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The EU invests in railroads, highways and data networks. Why does it
not invest much into
FOSS? &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/EUFOSSA2-Survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOSSA&lt;/a>
(hint: please participate in the survey!) is a good start. Much more
could be done. Civil society is stepping in to take over public
functions, as in the preservation of knowledge fostered by Wikipedia
or Software Heritage, often with little public support. What would be
a framework under which the EU and member states can invest into FOSS
development, to serve it&amp;rsquo;s own needs or to support support
sustainability goals? Can a public investment plan be developed for
the development of OSS ICT infrastructure, including goals and spends?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="commercial-business-models-and-open-source">Commercial Business Models and Open Source&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Much has been discussed recently about the sustainability of FOSS
development, often confusing it the viability of the own business
model. Norms that form the pillars of the FOSS movement like
the
&lt;a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four freedoms of software&lt;/a> or
the &lt;a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Definition&lt;/a> embody
community culture at the expense of legalistic terminology. Recently,
models have emerged that remove some of the freedoms guaranteed by
those norms, for example in the deceptively
named &lt;a href="https://commonsclause.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commons Clause License&lt;/a>. The
relation between FOSS and other rights like trademarks or patents is
still a much researched topic. Directly related to that are approaches
on how to valuate FOSS and FOSS based businesses to give guidance to
industry, VCs and policy makers for investment decisions. Some of our
fellows feel it is important to take a stand as a community, insist on
making it clear what FOSS really is and prevent a watering down of
standards like the Open Source Definition. There is a need to explain
the work of the wider FOSS community more clearly to illustrate how it
interacts with and contributes to society.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-contribute-and-get-involved">How to contribute and get involved&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The academy believes that these topic are of wide-ranging importance
to the development of the digital society and the single market in the
EU. They warrant a thorough investigation, deep analysis and a search
for solutions that connects research, industry and policy makers. We
hope to support this process by selecting these three subjects as
focus topics for the OpenForum Academy for the upcoming year. The
academy will facilitate the work of it&amp;rsquo;s fellows through workshops,
publications and other means. If you are a researcher, practitioner,

and
&lt;a href="https://www.openinventionnetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Invention Network (OIN)&lt;/a>
announced that Microsoft has become a member of the OIN community. OIN
is the largest patent non-aggression community in history with over
2.600 community member companies. It&amp;rsquo;s mission is to protect core Open
Source technologies from patent litigation. It shapes the norms of
collaboration as Open Source becomes more industrial and the edge
between free and proprietary software becomes increasingly
important. Many key innovators license their patent portfolio through
OIN, including Google, IBM, NEC, Philip, Red Hat, Sony, SUSE and
Toyota. Until now however, one party was missing from the community
that became an increasingly important contributor to Open Source
technologies, and that was Microsoft. This gap closes today. I believe
this is a historic moment that will encourage innovation and
dramatically reduces risks for the wider Open Source community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a Free Software contributor for more than twenty
years. Contributing for me was always about working towards the
creation of a large body of Free and Open Source Software that
benefits everybody. It was never about working &lt;em>against&lt;/em> something or
some entity. Later, I
started
&lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/mirkoboehm/cebit-opensourceforumpresentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presenting about Free Software arguing that &amp;ldquo;companies are community&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>,
a notion that at the time caused concern with many long-term Free
Software contributors. For me, this emphasizes that the Open Source
way is about working towards open collaboration with all interested
contributors.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When Free Software emerged, it was a strong competitor for all
incumbent proprietary software vendors, and Microsoft was one of the
largest of them. Some initial conflict was inevitable. However,
attitudes change and everybody learns. Eventually, Microsoft rather
impressively reinvented itself as an important Open Source
contributor. The announcement today is a culmination of the process
that completes for patent licensing what began with code releases and
major contributions to various
projects. Today,
&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-now-dominates-azure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux based workloads on Azure are quite common&lt;/a>. For
Microsoft, joining OIN resolves an inherent conflict that existed as a
leftover from the transition to being a major Free Software
contributor: If technologies are developed collaboratively, the
contributors should exercise joint stewardship over the result that is
released under an Open Source license. Extracting license revenue from
such collaboratively developed Open Source technology creates a rift
and undermines collaboration. By &amp;ldquo;making peace with the free world&amp;rdquo;
and joining OIN,
Microsoft
&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-may-relinquishing-billions-android-patent-royalties-141047213.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may pre-empt it&amp;rsquo;s own patent licensing revenue for Android and other technologies&lt;/a> covered
by the OIN Linux System definition, but it gains significant
reputation and acceptance in the wider Open Source community. Since
this is where software innovation is happening, the long-term benefits
of this strategy should outweigh the cost by far.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For Open Invention Network, today&amp;rsquo;s news are a major step
forward. Membership in the OIN community is free of charge. All
participants cross-license their patent portfolio within the
field-of-use definition of core Open Source technologies. It is not
necessary to hold a patent portfolio to join OIN. This means everybody
in the network immediately benefits from the
new
&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-joins-open-invention-network-to-help-protect-linux-and-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-licensing commitment of over 60.000 patents&lt;/a> made
by Microsoft. A network like OIN becomes more and more valuable the
more patents are cross-licensed and the more software technologies are
covered by that (a network effect :-). With Microsoft on board, it
should be even more obvious
that
&lt;a href="https://www.openinventionnetwork.com/joining-oin/join-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joining OIN&lt;/a> is
the best and also the easiest way to enter the patent “no-fly zone”
over Linux. This benefits Open Source innovation and the wider Open
Source community, which in turn contributes Free Software to the
common good. Everybody wins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FOSS, standard essential patents and FRAND in the European Union</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2018-jrc-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2018-jrc-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>As part of the research project

a workshop was organised by the European Commission, Joint Research
Centre (JRC) in collaboration with Directorate General Communications
Networks, Content and Technology (CONNECT) to present and discuss the
intermediate results to date. The workshop took place in Brussels on
September 18, 2018. I presented a set of observations from the research on

and &lt;a href="https://www.gesmer.com/team/andrew-s-updegrove" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andy Updegrove&lt;/a>
on &amp;ldquo;Dynamics in Standardisation&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may ask what the relevance of this debate is for the wider Free
and Open Source Software community. The obvious answer is that to
distribute
software
&lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/3/patent-grant-mit-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;without restriction&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>,
the user needs all the usage rights associated with the program. While
most FOSS contributors assume that this is naturally the central
motivation for anybody to contribute in the first place, there is a
long history of attempts to maintain some sort of exclusive control
over a piece of FOSS code, possibly using other rights than copyright.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contributor license agreements (CLA) are a well known instrument for
that. The original author agrees to an exclusive or non-exclusive
license to a central entity (usually a community organisation or a
dominating company) to use their work. This may just give a community
organisation a right to adopt newer licenses. Or it may give
a
&lt;a href="https://dirkriehle.com/publications/2009-selected/the-commercial-open-source-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single Open Source vendor&lt;/a> the
right to use other contributor&amp;rsquo;s work commercially. Whether CLA embody
FOSS culture or violate them by creating an asymmetric distribution of
benefits between contributors and a company therefore depends on the
specific terms of the
CLA. The
&lt;a href="http://contributoragreements.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributor agreements configurator&lt;/a> helps
projects to set up a CLA and understand what the motivation behind the
terms are (&lt;a href="https://endocode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endocode&lt;/a> contributed the
implementation). CLA are controversial, especially if they
include
&lt;a href="https://help.nextcloud.com/t/cla-caa-ca-etc-etc-let-s-get-it-right/588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">copyright assignments to a single company&lt;/a>. Projects
and contributors are well-advised to make sure to fully understand
what they are agreeing to. The main take-away for the argument here is
that the norm in FOSS communities is a &lt;em>symmetric&lt;/em> distribution of
rights between all contributors, and CLA are one instrument to modify
this to the benefit of a single entity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that is not all. It just helps to explain how such asymmetric
rights can be used to give a single entity more power in a community
of contributors. There is a long history of such attempts, and they
usually involve some other legal rights beyond the terms of the FOSS
license applied. There is a good reason for that: FOSS licenses give
contributors and users a time-tested and well-balanced framework for
collaboration. &lt;a href="https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Use, study, modify, redistribute&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> is
a simple, easy to understand mantra that every FOSS contributor knows
and understands. CLA augment the FOSS license terms with an additional
contractual agreement, but for the most part stay in the realm of
copyright just like FOSS licenses. Other instruments not so much:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Trademarks are used to enforce a vendor&amp;rsquo;s expectations when others
adopt and ship their software. This is used by communities to
protect their names, like in
the
&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/trademarks/policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla Trademark Policy&lt;/a>,
or to make sure specific services are included in devices, like in
the
&lt;a href="https://source.android.com/compatibility/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Compatibility Program&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trade secrets like delayed code releases under FOSS licenses or
proprietary &amp;ldquo;extensions&amp;rdquo; that
are
&lt;a href="https://about.mattermost.com/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effectively required for the software to be useful&lt;/a> are
used to maintain an edge of an &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; version over the FOSS
release.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/software-patents.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software patents debate&lt;/a> may
have slowed down, but is still relevant. Patents exist, and
applications for patents that include claims that are implemented in
existing FOSS solutions never stopped. It has become harder to be
granted a patent for a software-only solution. Institutions like
the &lt;a href="https://www.openinventionnetwork.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Invention Network&lt;/a>
create a safe space where FOSS innovators cross-license freely and
avoid litigation. However vendors shipping FOSS in products still
need to clear potential patent claims implemented in
those. Conformance with patents does not usually follow from FOSS
licenses.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Which leads to round five of the match with software freedom in one
corner and exclusivity in the other &amp;ndash; standard-essential patents
(SEP). Everybody loves standards, and FOSS especially: We use
standardised programming languages, unicode tables and system call
interfaces. Standards are the foundation for interoperability, and
some standards like
the &lt;a href="http://opendocumentformat.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Document Format&lt;/a> are the
result of a long struggle to establish formats that re-open markets
for competition. All of these standards
are
&lt;a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-are-open-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Standards&lt;/a> that
can be implemented in FOSS without restrictions. But what if
implementing a standard would be required to interoperate with others,
or even mandatory under existing regulations, and this standard would
include functionality that is covered by patent claims, possibly with
royalty-bearing patent licenses? That is the definition of SEP, which
are commonly required to be licensed either royalty-free or under
&amp;ldquo;fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory&amp;rdquo; (FRAND) licenses. It is also
a relevant and current concern because
the
&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/26583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Commission considers SEP under FRAND licenses a useful instrument&lt;/a> for
industrial policy in the European Union. Until now, the wider FOSS
community has contributed some positions to this debate that is for
the most part dominated by incumbent industries, recognized
standards-development organisations (SDO) and policy makers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The study currently conducted under the supervision by
the
&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC)&lt;/a> on
&lt;a href="https://www.creative-destruction.org/project/ec-jrc-oss-frand/">&amp;ldquo;The Interaction between Open Source Software and FRAND licensing in Standardisation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> aims
at providing a better understanding of the interplay between FOSS
licenses, governance and the IPR policies of SDO. At the workshop that
was just held in Brussels as part of this study where an initial set
of case studies on the subject have been presented. Theses case
studies (that I am the author of) will become part of the overall
study report prepared
by
&lt;a href="https://www.inno.tu-berlin.de/menue/about_us/team/prof_dr_rer_pol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knut Blind&lt;/a> and
me. As the study progresses, a number of early observations from these
cases will be shared in this blog and other channels. It is important
that the wider FOSS community recognizes the relevance and importance
of this subject and actively makes itself heard. CERN, the ECMAscript
community, the Eclipse Foundation, the Linux Foundation and others
have already contributed insights to the field work for the
project. Others, especially FSFE, have been notably absent from the
debate. The &lt;a href="https://opensource.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Initiative&lt;/a> is
represented on the project&amp;rsquo;s steering committee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The standards that
will be shaped by this debate, like 5G mobile communication or IoT
protocols, will affect us all, as will welfare gains or losses from
policies that influence the innovativeness of FOSS. There are
opportunities to contribute: communities can communicate what their

barriers for interaction between standardisation and open source
processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The study should clarify the role of open source in the context of
standard setting, in particular its interplay with the licensing of
standards-essential patents under &amp;ldquo;fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory&amp;rdquo; (FRAND) terms and provide an overview of free and
open source software (FOSS) and FRAND features in standardisation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The study on the interaction between open source software and FRAND
licensing in standardisation is carried out on behalf of the &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European
Commission&amp;rsquo;s Joint Research

&lt;h2 id="workshop-continuous-compliance---the-introduction-with-openchain-and-quartermaster">Workshop: Continuous Compliance - The Introduction, with OpenChain and Quartermaster&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As software development becomes ever more dependent on multiple open
source components, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that
the licences applicable to those components are respected. The
workshop moderators have extensive experience in FOSS compliance
issues, from both a legal and a technical perspective, within the
framework of the Linux Foundation’s OpenChain as well as the
Quartermaster Compliance Tooling project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obtaining OpenChain compliance is a daunting task, for industrial or
even ICT-based companies who have been working with open source for
some time, have entrenched development, sales and distribution
practices, and no real idea or control over FOSS usage. It requires
not just a superficial documentary process (getting the license
information, finding the source code) but a “sea” change in quality
assurance processes in the company. OpenChain focuses on roles,
processes (and artefacts). The combination with Quartermaster helps in
achieving compliance by automating &amp;ldquo;best practises&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshop will focus on the objectives of the OpenChain conformance
work at a client, the planning and processes involved, and challenges
met so far based on real life experience. We want to share materials
we are using, work on creating better model documentation for this
type of activity, and discuss and eventually publish “best” practices,
and are looking forward to hearing, and building, on the experiences
of the workshop attendees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This workshop will not just be a presentation of materials, cases and
examples by the moderators, but requires active input from attendees
to suggest new methods of achieving compliance, creating improved
documentation and processes that can be shared with the community. We
hope to benchmark typical scenarios and challenges and find responses
for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This section of the workshop will lead into the the subsequent session
during which automation and technological facilitation of the
compliance process will be demonstrated and explored based on the
Quartermaster toolchain. The session will demonstrate how to
instrument software builds to gather essential compliance data, run
standard and custom analysis to identify licenses, authors, copyright
holders or compliance with company policies, and then generate
up-to-date, accurate and complete reports for distribution with the
product as well as to give feedback to software developers about
detected compliance issues or quality metrics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who: The workshop moderators include OpenChain Partners who are also
partners at their law firms advising clients on open source legal
issues, as well as FOSS compliance tool makers. It is aimed at any
individual involved in implementing or advising on open source
compliance (and not just in the “supply chain”).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why attend: Through this workshop, you will not only gain a fuller
understanding of the OpenChain specification itself, but also see what
materials for OC conformance are available, and, in conjunction with
the subsequent session, get a view on some tools that are being used
(or built!), work on your own or shared materials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Source und Smart Services - Chancen durch Standards und Normen</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/talk/2018-cebit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/talk/2018-cebit/</guid><description>&lt;p>The German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology holds a

the first time we could present Quartermaster to a wider management
level audience. It raised quite some interest:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the abstract of the talk:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quartermaster aims art building an industry standard of tooling that
supports the Open Source license compliance workflow. It&amp;rsquo;s workflow
engine integrates existing scanning and reporting tools, and
integrates into CI/CD processes. It offers API endpoints against which
toolmakers, communities and service providers can integrate their
products into the open source and open data model of the elemental
toolchain. Development of the Quartermaster prototype resulted in a
number of key findings, especially that source packages alone do not
identify and convey sufficient license information, or that the
product build process may be the best time to check compliance. The
presentation introduces the Quartermaster project, the novel approach
it takes on implementing Open Source compliance tooling, and how the
lessons learned from the prototype influenced the Quartermaster
toolchain architecture.&lt;/p>

This
software drives innovation and enables everybody to access and use
computers, whether or not they can afford new hardware or commercial
software. So that&amp;rsquo;s that, the benefit to society is obvious. Everybody
should just get behind it and support it. Right? Well, it is not that
easy. Especially when it comes to principles of individual freedom or
trade-offs between self-determination and convenience, it is difficult
to communicate the message in a way that it reaches and activates a
wider audience. How can we explain the difference between Free
Software and services available at no cost (except them spying at you)
best? Campaigning for software freedom is not easy. However, it is
part of the Free Software Foundation Europe&amp;rsquo;s mission. The FSFE teamed
up with &lt;a href="https://www.pen.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peng! Collective&lt;/a> to learn how to run
influential campaigns to promote the cause of Free Software. The Peng
Collective is a Berlin based group of activists who are known for
their successful and quite subversive campaigns for political
causes. And Endocode? Endocode is a sponsor of the Free Software
Foundation Europe. We are a sponsor because free software is essential
to us, both as a company and as members of society. And so here we
are.&lt;/p>

Super secret conspiracy workshop
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>There are some exciting, courageous and engaging campaigns that focus
on communicating complex political
goals. The
&lt;a href="http://www.fluchthelfer.in/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escape helpers campaign&lt;/a> leaves
the audience conflicted between the two choices of being a good human
rights activists (driven by ideals and demonstrating solidarity with
refugees) and being a good citizen (by abiding to the law). Great,
because the message is to re-think what is legal against what is
right. The
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At9rWPj7MzU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#slamshell performance&lt;/a>
emotionally demonstrated the risks associated with oil drilling that
are normally regarded as marginal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These campaigns translate abstract, distant risks or worries into
concrete, tangible calls to action. By being provocative, they break
the mold and reach a wide audience online and through
traditional media. They are &amp;ldquo;cat content for social change&amp;rdquo;, as our
tutors put it. Campaigners are being urged to stop preaching or
complaining and to start using positive communication combined with
subversive PR work instead. Such messaging needs punchlines, which
requires some kind of hyperbole - dadaism, hijacking attention, or
provocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Campaign development is still a pretty down to earth task. Through
fact finding research and the analysis of campaign goals, supporting
allies and potential opponents, answers to the four essential
questions are being narrowed down: What is the change that we want to
achieve? How can this change be brought about? Who can make that
change we want to see? And who has power over the involved people or
groups? Setting campaign goals is often a compromise between achieving
big changes locally or small changes &amp;ldquo;globally&amp;rdquo;. It helps to envision
the impact of the campaign through utopia/dystopia brainstorms: What
would a world look like where all campaign goals have been achieved
perfectly? What would it look like if everything went horribly wrong?
These kind of mental exercises also help to explain the relevance of
the campaign goals and show how the intended change can affect
people&amp;rsquo;s lives. The goals may be perfectly obvious to those passionate
about them already, but not to outsiders - a common problem regarding
the ethics and ideals of Free Software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implementing a campaign involves many standard, by the book project
management tasks. The individual publicity stunts and activities are
the actions that form the campaign timeline. A dilemma specific to the
FSFE is that the relevant and influential media - social networks
especially - are the kind of centralized proprietary platforms against
which we are advocating. However, we learned that it may be possible
to play this situation to our advantage :-) Since the FSFE&amp;rsquo;s goals
require some heavy lifting of Free Software lobbying, the campaign
timeline extends far into the future. We found ourselves thinking
about what to present at conferences a year or more into the
future. Finalizing the campaign plan involves answering the
&amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; question of what time, material and talent is required to
perform the tasks, and to put them into a timeline. Often this
includes outside help for extra manpower or professional
expertise. Noticeably, those with technical backgrounds tend to haste
towards a release, underestimating the lead time required to get
there, and the duration of the campaign. This tendency works almost,
but not quite, entirely unlike in software projects. Securing and
confirming the support of allies and protagonists also takes time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The planned actions need to be reviewed with a focus group that
resembles or at least understands the target audience. This review
should confirm that the message conveyed is in fact understandable and
makes sense. It is not possible to get a clear answer on whether or
not a campaign project needs an ultimate decision maker. The answer
depends too much on the composition of the campaign team and the
timeline of the project. The necessary communication infrastructure is
pretty straightforward - tasks boards, and instead and asynchronous
messaging. Most Free Software groups use those anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After two and a half days of workshop, all 15 participants ended
up rather tired. However we had plenty of fun and learned
a lot. Surprisingly, the group came up with a good amount of
real, usable ideas for activities. Be very afraid :-) The guidance
and mentoring by the experienced campaigners from Peng! Collective
helped tremendously. Of course the workshop was merely an exercise in
how to develop and run a campaign for software freedom. The bulk of
the work is now ahead of us. But we are off to a good start. We
are curious where this road will take us.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An analytical review of text and data mining practices and approaches in Europe</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/ofe-tdm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/ofe-tdm/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="policy-recommendations-in-view-of-the-upcoming-copyright-legislative-proposal">Policy recommendations in view of the upcoming copyright legislative proposal&lt;/h2>

&amp;ldquo;Exceptions to Copyright&amp;rdquo; brief (October 2014), as well as numerous
other reports, position papers, articles and blog posts. The initial
findings have been discussed at the Round Table that OFE organised in
October 2015, the conclusions of which are available in the follow-up
White Paper. The desk research and Round Table discussion have been
complemented by a series of interviews with academics, researchers,

&lt;p>The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 and since then
promotes computer users’ rights to use, study, copy, modify, and
redistribute computer programs. It also helps to spread awareness of
the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The birthday party in Berlin, organised by FSFE, will take place from
&lt;em>15:00 to 18:00 on 3 October 2015&lt;/em> at Endocode AG, &lt;a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.51290&amp;amp;amp;mlon=13.41781#map=17/52.51290/13.41781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brückenstraße 5A,

multiple operations at the same time. A common problem is that the
user sees the application pause. A typical requirement is that an
operation which may take an arbitrary amount of time because it is,
for example, performing disk I/O, is scheduled for execution but
immediately taken of the main thread of the application (the one that
starts &lt;code>main()&lt;/code>). To illustrate how this problem would be solved and to
jump right into using ThreadWeaver, let&amp;rsquo;s simulate this problem by
printing &lt;em>Hello World!&lt;/em>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> as the asynchronous payload:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="k">using&lt;/span> &lt;span class="k">namespace&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ThreadWeaver&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="n">stream&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">make_job&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">[]()&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">qDebug&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">);&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This short but complete program written in C++11 outputs the common
greeting to the command line.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> It does so, however, from a worker
thread managed by the global ThreadWeaver queue. The header file
&lt;code>ThreadWeaver/ThreadWeaver&lt;/code> included in line 2 contains the essential
declarations needed to use the most common ThreadWeaver
operations. The components used in this examples are the global queue,
a job and a queueing mechanism. The global queue is a singleton
instance of the ThreadWeaver thread pool that is instantiated when it
it first accessed after the application starts. A job represents
&amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; that should be executed asynchroneously. In this case, the
thing to execute is a C++ lambda function that prints the welcome
message. The queueing mechanism used here is a queue stream, an API
inspired by the &lt;em>iostream&lt;/em> family of classes. ThreadWeaver builds on
top of Qt, and similar to most Qt applications requires a
QCoreApplication (or one of its descendants) to exist throughout the
lifetime of the application. Up to line 7, the program looks like any
other Qt application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To have the job lambda function called by one of the worker threads, a
job is created that wraps it using the &lt;code>make_job()&lt;/code>. It is then handed
to the queue stream. The queue stream will submit the jobs for
execution when the queuing command is completed, that is at the
closing semicolon. Once the job is queued, one of the worker threads
will automatically pick it up from the queue and execute
it. &lt;code>ThreadWeaver::Job&lt;/code> is the unit of execution handled by
ThreadWeaver queues. Jobs are simple runnable types that perform one
task, defined in their &lt;code>run()&lt;/code> method. Some jobs wrap a
lambda function as in this example or decorate other jobs. However
implementing custom, reusable job classes is only a matter of writing
a class that inherits &lt;code>ThreadWeaver::Job&lt;/code> and re-implementing
it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>run&lt;/code> method. The job that was created by &lt;code>make_job()&lt;/code>
in this example wraps the specified lambda function, and executes it
when it is itself executed by a worker thread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program does not specify where the job should be executed, and not
even when exactly. In a scenario where there would be many jobs
waiting in the queue, execution of the new job would not be
immediate. Which worker thread will be assigned the job is also
undefined. The programmer gives up a bit of control over the details
of execution, and in turns benefits from the automatic distribution of
jobs amongst the available processors by the worker threads in the
queue. Every program that links the ThreadWeaver library has access to
a global queue for the execution of jobs. If no queue is specified
when enqueueing a job, the global one will be used by default. Workers
threads are allocated when needed by the queue. If the global pool is
never accessed by an application, it will never be instantiated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An application performing tasks in background threads should never
exit while any of these operations is still in progress. In the case
of ThreadWeaver, this means all jobs in the queue need to be either
completed or dequeued and all worker threads idle before the
application may exit. The global pool is in fact a QObject child of
the &lt;code>QCoreApplication&lt;/code> object instantiated in line 7. It will be
deleted by the destructor of QCoreApplication. When it is destroyed,
it will wait until all queued up jobs have completed. The program will
thus wait in line 8 until the job has finished printing &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;
and will then exit. The job was enqueued as a shared pointer, so
memory management is taken care of. While this example was very much
simplified, the described functionality already has many practical
applications. For example, the many operations real-life applications
need to perform at startup, like loading translations, icon resources
et cetera, can be removed from the criticial path this way. In this
case the operations usually need to be performed in a certain order
and then handed over to the main thread. Solutions for that are built
into ThreadWeaver as well.&lt;/p>

Frameworks&lt;/a>,
the new, modularised incarnation of what was previously distributed
simply as the KDE libraries. The new frameworks are drop-in extensions
to Qt applications, with minimal and well-documented dependencies for
easier deployment. The tech preview contains two frameworks that are
marked as mature, namely KArchive and ThreadWeaver. The updated
ThreadWeaver was my major piece of library coding work in 2013, and
was finished just in time for the release. Even though it is a tech
preview, it is stable, and no major (or even significant but minor)
changes in the current API are expected until the final
release. Programmers are already encouraged to use it, and provide
feedback and bug reports.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>ThreadWeaver is a concurrent execution scheduler written in
C++. Available for all target platforms of the Qt framework, including
desktop, mobile and embedded environments, ThreadWeaver delivers
concurrent execution of tasks, load balancing with regard to
user-defined criteria, multiple independent queues, processing graph
modelling, aggregate jobs and other comprehensive features. As all
other KDE frameworks, ThreadWeaver is Free Software. Its only
dependency is Qt, which makes it a tier 1 framework in KDE&amp;rsquo;s lingo.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A number of the &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mirkoboehm/thread-weaver-in-kde-frameworks-5%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new features of
ThreadWeaver&lt;/a>
were announced at Akademy 2013. Jobs, the unit of concurrent execution
in ThreadWeaver, are now managed by the queue using shared pointers,
meaning that auto-delete behaviour is implicit and controlled by the
user. Helper templates are available to queue stack or member
variables, so allocation of jobs can be static or dynamic. Functors or
lambda functions can be used to construct jobs. Job aggregates like
collections and sequences now execute their own run() method before
queueing their elements, so that aggregates can generate their own
elements. Success and queueing state of jobs are now integrated into a
single status. Jobs can signal the result of execution by setting a
status, but also using exceptions, simplifying error reporting in more
complex job classes. Jobs can be decorated, and no more inherit
QObject by default. Decorators can be used to add signals, change
priorities or modify just about any behaviour of jobs independently of
the actual job class used. The construction of the global queue can
now be customised using a queue factory. The QueueStream API greatly
simplifies queueing jobs with a familiar iostream-like C++ syntax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ThreadWeaver follows the Unix idiom of doing one thing, and doing it
right. Similar to how small Unix programs can be combined to create an
practically infinite space of computing solutions, ThreadWeaver offers
itself to programmers as an add-on module with minimal
dependencies. Including it extends an application with concurrent
scheduling capability. But the same Unix idiom is also applied in a
second sense. Within ThreadWeaver, a few basic concepts – jobs and
their aggregates, queues and policies – are implemented that again
provide simple building blocks that can be combined creatively,
offering a vast space of potential solutions within the scope of the
application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history of ThreadWeaver goes back to KDE 3. The idea of
implementing a thread pool based execution scheduler that manages
dependencies between jobs was implemented as a proof of concept using
Qt 3. However it turned out to be difficult to implement and use
because of the lack of thread-safe reference counting of the
implicitly shared classes at the time. These fundamental problems have
been solved with the release of Qt 4. Additionally, the introduction
of cross-thread signal-slot connections further simplified the
communication between jobs and the application&amp;rsquo;s user interface. The
first production ready version of ThreadWeaver was released as part of
KDELibs with KDE 4.0. For KDE Frameworks 5, it was almost completely
re-written to simplify memory management of jobs, make use of new Qt 5
features like atomic variables, and in part to reflect new language
constructs in C++11 like lambda functions. ThreadWeaver comes with an
extensive set of unit tests that all pass in the tech preview (hear,
hear).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following weeks and months, the framework will be polished and
debugged based on user feedback. Also, a series of posts here on this
blog will introduce individual ThreadWeaver concepts and features in
depth, mostly based on example programs, including contrasting it to
thread handling in Qt using QThread or Qt Concurrent. ThreadWeaver is
very close to production quality, having been tested continuously in
the last couple of months. There may still be smaller, source
compatible changes to the framework. We ask interested programmers out
there to provide feedback and bug reports to make ThreadWeaver what it
should be &amp;ndash; a worry-free, easy to use and powerful add-on to Qt that
programmers enjoy using. Have fun!&lt;/p>

statt. In diesem Jahr mit dabei war das Seminar &lt;a href="http://www.evstudienwerk.de/aktuelles/veranstaltungen/sommeruniversitaet/65.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source in
Wirtschaft und
Gesellschaft&lt;/a>
von Mirko Boehm. Paul Adams unterstützte als Ko-Referent. Karsten
Gerloff, Präsident der &lt;a href="http://fsfe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FSFE&lt;/a>, trat als Gastredner
auf. Da sich die Teilnehmer ihre Seminare nach eigenem Interesse
selbst aussuchen, fand sich ein bunte Mischung von Medizinern über
Naturwissenschaftlern bis zu Theologen zusammen. Die Verbindung aus
Neugier, Heterogenität der Gruppe und inspirierender Umgebung sorgte
für explosive Debatten, hitzige Diskussionsrunden und eine wie Flug
vergangene Woche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Schwerpunkte des Seminars waren die Fragen, wie
Open-Source-Communities eigentlich funktionieren, was Einzelne zur
Mitwirkung motiviert, wie sich freie Produkte in die
Wirtschaftsordnung integrieren und welche politischen
Herausforderungen und Veränderungen zu bewältigen sind. Während
schnell Einverständnis herrschte darüber, das der &lt;em>Open Source Way&lt;/em>
ein gesellschaftliches und kein technisches Problem ist, wurde zu

Verantwortung für durch unvorsichtige Bewertungen beschädigte
Reputation, muss alle Teilhabe in Zukunft im Netz stattfinden, braucht
es eine Internetpolizei, das Strafrecht der realen Welt erweiternde
Sanktionen, die Regulierung des Netzes? Durch die diversen Blickwinkel
war manchmal nicht klar, wer mehr von wem lernte, die Seminarleitung
oder die Teilnehmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Karsten Gerloff berichtete über die politische Bedeutung von Freier
Software und offener Innovation, die Bedrohung durch Softwarepatente
und die Kampagnenarbeit der FSFE.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Die Beschäftigung mit der Materie war dabei von deutlicher
Ernsthaftigkeit geprägt. Zum Beispiel brauchten die Teilnehmer etwa
fünf Minuten, um den systematischen Unterschied bei der Integration
von Copyleft- oder Permissive-lizensierten Beiträgen zu verstehen -
ein Prozess, der bei nicht wenigen Freie-Software-Communities entweder
gar nicht oder erst recht spät verstanden wird. Paul Adams war
sichtlich beeindruckt. Dieses tiefe Eintauchen ins Thema steht
beispielhaft für das allgemein starke Engagement der Stipendiaten, die
ihr Studienwerk in weiten Bereichen selbst verwalten - bis hin zur
Zusammenstellung des Programms der Sommeruniversität selbst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bei der traditionell turbulenten Abschlussveranstaltung am
Donnerstagabend wurden die &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vier

verdeutlicht&amp;hellip; Unser einstimmiges Fazit - definitiv eine Woche
lohnend investierter Zeit, die Paul Adams und ich in guter Erinnerung
behalten werden. Neben den Teilnehmern war auch das Organisationsteam
(ebenfalls sich freiwillig engagierende Stipendiaten) ausgesprochen
engagiert und sorgte für einen reibungslosen, angenehmen Ablauf von
insgesamt sechs parallel verlaufenden Seminaren. Sehr beeindruckend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>KDE rejects Fairsearch initiative claims: Free Software is competitive</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2013-09-kde-nope-to-fairsearch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2013 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2013-09-kde-nope-to-fairsearch/</guid><description>&lt;p>The KDE community is deeply concerned by the wrong notion contained in
the recent complaint by the &lt;a href="http://www.fairsearch.org/mobile/fairsearch-announces-complaint-in-eu-on-googles-anti-competitive-mobile-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairsearch initiative
claiming&lt;/a>
that &amp;ldquo;distribution of Android at below-cost&amp;rdquo; could constitute
anti-competitive behaviour or predatory pricing. Free Software
platforms like KDE or Android are open to all actors without
discrimination and at extremely low barriers of entry. The fact that
Free Software solutions offer attractive alternatives to proprietary
closed-source offerings makes it more competitive, not less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KDE is one of the largest volunteer-driven Free Software&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
communities. The KDE community builds a free platform to create user
experiences for desktop, mobile and other devices, and invites
individuals and companies to extend and build upon this platform. Our
community is a world-wide collaboration of companies and individuals
that together create programs in an openly governed development
process. Millions of users benefit from the programs that are
distributed under a Free Software license that guarantees the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four
Freedoms of
software&lt;/a>. This license
means that our users and contributors together create a public good
that others can redistribute or build upon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The KDE Community calls on the European Commission to very
carefully analyze the Fairsearch complaint for attempts to reduce the
strong competition of Free Software platforms like KDE or Android to
proprietary non-free offerings. We encourage the European Commission
to understand that Free Software truly fosters innovation and
increases competition, and to protect the liberty of our contributors
and those of other communities to collaboratively create and
distribute Free Software as a common good.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-four-freedoms-force-actors-to-compete-within-markets-not-for-control-over-markets">The &amp;ldquo;Four Freedoms&amp;rdquo; force actors to compete within markets, not for control over markets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Free Software provides a level playing field for all competitors. By
minimizing barriers of entry and eliminating discrimination of access
to formats, standards and technologies, Free Software platforms create
comparable starting positions for all actors, leaving them with
options to convince customers about (with) the functionality of their
products and the quality of their services. Lock-in and artificial
market segregation through discriminative licensing or essential
technologies are systematically reduced. In fact, the most popular
Free Software licence, the GPL, clearly forbids any kind of
discrimination of use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consumers benefit from this openness by having choice between multiple
interoperable products and by lower prices through increased
competition. This is because Free Software implies open standards
accessible to any party willing to implement them. The Free Software
nature of the platforms fosters the proliferation of technical
understanding and skills, improving the chances for the development of
a more diverse, less concentrated technology business ecosystem. These
concrete opportunities for economic development specifically in the
European Union are endangered if Free Software platforms are penalized
because of misunderstood complaints of predatory pricing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The claim of anti-competitiveness of Free Software platforms is
untenable. Even in the extraordinary situation where only one entity
contributes to development, the licenses under which the products are
distributed explicitly rule out almost all typical forms of
anti-competitive behaviour like exclusive dealing (for example through
selective partnership licensing programs), any kind of fixed or
barrier pricing or territorial divisions often employed by proprietary
vendors. While trademarks can be used to limit platform fragmentation,
they will not leverage control over competing products based on the
Free Software platform itself. For example, Kindle Fire and Facebook
Phone are products build upon the Android Open Source Project platform
without any further restrictions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the open, competitive nature of Free Software platform fosters
confidence in users and vendors that the risk of undue lock-in is
minimal, an obvious trend towards de facto standardization on open
platforms is observable in many technological fields including the
mobile space. Since actors are usually not inclined to voluntarily
return to the strong lock-in of proprietary platforms, vendors of
proprietary platforms have shown a tendency towards hampering the
emergence of Free Software platforms by spreading &amp;ldquo;FUD&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fear, uncertainty
and
doubt&lt;/a>). Volunteer-driven
Free Software communities rely on regulators to identify these
attempts and to provide protection of open innovation against the
vested interest of strong proprietary players.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion---free-software-platforms-are-competitive-by-nature">Conclusion - Free Software platforms are competitive by nature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The KDE Community is asking the European Commission to protect the
liberty to develop and distribute platforms under accepted Free
Software licenses providing the Four Freedoms to all potential users
and to derivative works, and to recognize the overwhelming benefit to
the public provided by open and collaborative innovation processes. We
have shown that the elements of Free Software licenses largely
eliminate the possibility of anti-competitive behaviour, especially by
forbidding discrimination between users of the product. The predatory
pricing claims against Free Software platforms in the recent
Fairsearch complaint are wrong in substance and hurtful to
collaborative development and open innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sincerely,&lt;/p>

The test vote before the assembly officially started
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://akademy2013.kde.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Akademy 2013&lt;/a> is still on its way, and as
usual the KDE e.V. General Assembly was held as a part of it. KDE
e.V. is the representation and governance body of the KDE
community. Membership in this not-for-profit association registered in
Berlin, Germany is open to all KDE contributors . Members usually
assemble once a year to coordinate, to vote on issues important to the
community and to elect representatives and board members as
needed. The highlights this year where the discussion of the role of
the Community Working Group, the report on the first activities of the
newly established Financial Working Group, and the election of one
new board member. I was the chairperson of the assembly, and this is
my inofficial report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The role of KDE e.V. is somewhat described by &amp;ldquo;standing on the
shoulders of giants&amp;rdquo;. It is made up by community members interested
in governance matters, and represents the wider KDE community that
encompasses all non-technical and technical contributors. On one hand
KDE e.V. takes a passive stance, in that it does not directly
influence the direction the development of KDE is taking. On the other
hand it plays an important role and invariably influences the
community by receicing donations, managing funding of development
sprints and meetings, covering operational costs like hardware and
infrastructure, and of course by running the Akademy conference year
after year. This setup is reflected in the working groups that act as
focal points for various fields of interest within the
community. Working groups as established for marketing, system
administration, community, user relations and finance. Notably absent
is a development working group, it is commonly accepted that this is
not KDE e.V.&amp;rsquo;s concern. The membership elects a five person board that
coordinates the work of the KDE e.V. members and the working
groups. KDE e.V. currently has 169 active members, which is an
impressive number considering it&amp;rsquo;s non-technical focus in a
development community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The abbreviation &amp;ldquo;e.V.&amp;rdquo; stands for &amp;ldquo;eingetragener Verein&amp;rdquo;, German for
&amp;ldquo;registered association&amp;rdquo;. It functions much like a shareholders
company in which every member holds exactly one share. This means the
membership as a whole is the proprietor of all assets owned by the KDE
community, including the KDE trademark and the operational
infrastructure. A new member joins the group of joint owners of KDE -
quite a responsibility. Dictated by the principle of congruence of
power and responsibility the membership in turn assumes the right to
allocate funds, elect representatives to related communities et
cetera. Because of that, it is necessary that the KDE e.V. membership
represents the community of KDE contributors as broadly as
possible. Every committed KDE contributor is encouraged to seek
membership. Send an email to the &lt;a href="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE community mailing
list&lt;/a> to express
your interest to become a member (&lt;a href="http://ev.kde.org/getinvolved/members.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to become a KDE
e.V. member&lt;/a>). Only
individuals can be members, organizations are invited to become
supporting members. As a bonus, supporting members are invited to
attend the general assembly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year&amp;rsquo;s assembly started routinely with the report of the board
and the different &lt;a href="http://ev.kde.org/workinggroups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working
groups&lt;/a>. Official meeting minutes
will be published later, but it is fair to say that KDE&amp;rsquo;s house is
generally in good order. The board is focused on the transition of
the KDE community to an umbrella for various Free Software efforts as
described in the &lt;a href="http://manifesto.kde.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE Manifesto&lt;/a>. As
projects join the KDE Community, the existing structure of internal
representation needs to be updated to reflect the interests of these
sub-communities. As everything in KDE this is a work in progress, the
first step look rather promising. The marketing working group is
preparing a campaign to advertise the use of the upcoming KDE
frameworks on top of Qt. The treasurer and the auditors of
the accounting reported a small surplus in the fiscal year of 2012
that will be used to fund additional KDE activities
in 2013. Spending is well aligned with KDE e.V.&amp;rsquo;s goal and tightly
supervised. A new system of accounts and cost codes will provide
better insight in the income and expenses incurred by the various
activities and events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mission of the User Working Group established in 2012 is the give
KDE users a representation within the community and &lt;a href="https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-is-open-source-democratic/">involve them more
in KDE
development&lt;/a>. This
effort still needs more pickup. Growing the role of the User Working
Group is very important, since the strength of Free Software is only
realised by users and developers forming the communities together. It
will need a charter, user representatives to KDE e.V., and routine
activities of involving KDE users in development and quality
improvement efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Community Working Group moderates how contributors work
together. The principle of KDE e.V. assuming a passive, supporting
role is routinely challenged whenever the community asks the Community
Working Group to resolve conflicts. The KDE Manifesto makes it very
clear that KDE is an inclusive community with a strong sense for
intrinsically motivated, voluntary contribution. Exercising authority
in such a setup is tricky - it should be reduced to a minimum, however
that minimum needs to be determined in some way. Even occasional
abuse, rudeness or bad manners set the tone of the community and can
cause substantial damage. So far KDE in general lacks instruments to
control that damage effectively. Sadly, few individual cases were not
resolved for extended periods of time, causing contributors to leave
the community. The discussion of how to empower the Community Working
Group and find a generic way to manage such situations took ginormous
time, but was definitely worth it. However, it is not over. A conflict
resolution BoF session was held on Monday, and a policy will be
proposed to the membership in the weeks after Akademy. The Community
Working Group has earned a lot of respect by me and many others with
the prudent and calm way it handles these issues, especialy
considering the amount of frustration dealing with such issues can
cause. It needs the support of all of us to define how the standards
set by the KDE Manifesto and the &lt;a href="http://www.kde.org/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code of
Conduct&lt;/a> can be achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Albert Astals Cid was elected for the vacant board seat in an
incredibly tight race (a tie in the first round of voting, and a
one vote win in the second). Competitive votes like that show that
there is choice, and that the future of KDE is defined by the
contributors. Congratulations, Albert! Many thanks to both Albert and
Marta Rybczynska for their candidacy, and to everybody who grilled the
candidates during the questions and answers session. Sebastian Kügler
stepped down after being a board member since 2006 - many thanks to
him as well for all the great work he has done. Subscribe to the &lt;a href="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE

Spain. It will be prefixed on July 12 by the general assembly
of &lt;a href="http://ev.kde.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE e.V.&lt;/a>, the charitable foundation that
supports the development of KDE. As usual, it will be followed by a
full week of frantic, collaborative hacking, birds of a
feather sessions and
mini-conferences. &lt;a href="http://qt-project.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qt Project&lt;/a> and the KDE
Community are very close companions, and this year for the first time
the
&lt;a href="http://qt-project.org/groups/qt-contributors-summit-2013/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qt Contributor Summit&lt;/a> will
be co-located with Akademy and take place July 14 and 15. In short, if
you haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a Free Software community conference like that,
this the one of the most awesome of them all, and the Qt Contributor
Summit only adds more greatness to it. I am on the way to it, to chair
the general assembly and to give a presentation on the concepts and
philosophy of Threadweaver.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last year at Akademy,
my
&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mirkoboehm/meritocracy-in-kde" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meritocracy in KDE&lt;/a> presentation
was all about meritocracy, Open Governance and how the KDE Community
can evolve to be attractive to contributors of all kinds and flavors,
especially beyond coders. KDE is headed to morph into an umbrella
community for similarily minded end-user focused Free Software
projects, based on a set of shared values and ideals. Being an ex
long-time KDE e.V. board member inevitably provides a certain high
level perspective on governance related matters, and the presentation
focused on providing food for thought for this process. It was the
conference where we drafted
the &lt;a href="http://manifesto.kde.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE Manifesto&lt;/a>. After long
consideration, it was published later in 2012 and represents an
excellent summary of what the community and it&amp;rsquo;s contributors believe
in. Kudos again to all who contributed to that,
especially
&lt;a href="http://ervin.ipsquad.net/tags/kde-manifesto-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Ottens&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Too much of community building, politico-economic analysis and
meta-thinking is not good for mental health (besides, I do a lot of
that all year around at
the
&lt;a href="http://www.inno.tu-berlin.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technical University of Berlin&lt;/a>). So
for this year, the goal was to go back to the basics, and take part in
the ongoing work to modernize KDE&amp;rsquo;s frameworks by refactoring and
updating
&lt;a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/threadweaver/html/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Threadweaver&lt;/a>. Real,
actual lower-level coding work, also known as pure bliss. Threadweaver
is KDE&amp;rsquo;s concurrency scheduler. It&amp;rsquo;s goal is provide an abstraction of
multithreading and concurrency suitable for developers of end-user
applications, and make it as simple as possible in the
process. Threadweaver has been in KDE since 4.0, but C++ idioms and
Qt, which it builds upon, have evolved dramatically since KDE 4 was
first released. So an update was in order. The development work on the
new version of the Threadweaver core is mostly complete, and ready to
be introduced at Akademy (all changes are in the kdelibs repository,
for the
curious). The
&lt;a href="https://conf.kde.org/en/Akademy2013/public/events/51" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation&lt;/a>
is suitable for newcomers as well, and will contain a programming
introduction, a chapter on Threadweaver&amp;rsquo;s philosophy and concept, and
a discussion of performance considerations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am writing this post on the direct flight from Berlin to Bilbao that
I reached after a bit of an eventfull journey to
the airport. Expecting that an nice extra 15 minutes buffer time to
account for the unexpected should be plenty, the taxi driver got
pulled over by the police for driving
at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ludicrous speed&lt;/a> (31 km/h
in a 20 km/h zone), then navigated around a traffic jam at
a construction site, and got delayed again when a scenic tour bus
got stuck after thinking it would be a great idea to pass through a
single lane road that was about three centimeters wider than the
bus itself (a road which, of course, we had to pass from the
other direction). I got to the airport just in time for boarding
and leisurely strolled onto the plane, since I was already
boarded. Should have accounted for 20 minutes of unexpected
events, bad planning on my part, I guess. However, the headphones are
playing Telegraph Road by the Dire Straits, and I am going to
Akademy. Looking forward to see you there, my friends. If you want to
meet me at Akademy, send me a tweet @mirkoboehm, or email to

&lt;p>Open-Source-Communities gelten als selbstgesteuert, meritokratisch et
cetera, aber ein besonderer demokratischer Charakter ihres
Funktionierens steht selten im Vordergrund. Einzelne investieren oft
großen Aufwand in ihr Lieblingsprojekt, um zu einem größeren Ganzen
beizutragen, und Demokratie gilt ebenfalls oft als höheres Gut. Es ist
daher verlockend, vom einen aufs andere zu schließen und
Open-Source-Communities ebenfalls als grundsätzlich demokratisch
anzunehmen. Aber ist das wirklich der Fall? Was bedeutet Demokratie im
Kontext von Open Source eigentlich? Wie würde eine demokratische
Open-Source-Community aussehen?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep Packet Inspection und Gute Software, schlechte Software</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-11-09-deep-packet-inspection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Nov 2012 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-11-09-deep-packet-inspection/</guid><description>&lt;p>Auf dem Netzpolitischen Abend des Digitalen Gesellschaft e.V. trug
Christian Mihr von Reporter ohne Grenzen vorgestern zum Export von
Überwachungssoftware deutscher Provenienz vor. &amp;ldquo;Made in Germany&amp;rdquo; steht
für die zweifelhafte Errungenschaft, dass in Diktaturen
Überwachungssoftware aus Deutschland eingesetzt wird, um politische
Gegner zu verfolgen und Meinungsfreiheit zu unterdrücken. Dabei gibt
es Hinweise, dass die deutsche Regierung den Export solcher Software
nicht nur billigt, sondern sogar aktiv durch Hermes-Bürgschaften
unterstützt.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Die Rechtmässigkeit des Exports dieser Güter wird regelmässig mit dem
Dual-Use-Argument begründet, also damit, dass die Überwachungssoftware
durchaus für zivile Zwecke eingesetzt werden könnte und deshalb
exportiert werden darf. Die zivile Nutzung wird in der Öffentlichkeit
in den Vordergrund gestellt. Praktisch wird die Software aber nahezu
ausschliesslich zur Überwachung politisch unliebsamer Meinungen durch
Ausspähen von Userdaten und Mithören von Kommunikation
verwendet. Zivile Anwendungen sind zwar theoretisch möglich, aber auch
mit Phantasie kaum vorstellbar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reporter ohne Grenzen fordert deshalb in einem Positionspapier zum
Internet Governance Forum in Baku die Ausweitung des Geltungsbereichs
von Rüstungsexportkontrollen auf Software, die zur Überwachung
eingesetzt werden kann. Dies ist zu begrüssen, denn Überwachung ist
ein Angriff auf Netzneutralität und eine freiheitliche
Willensbildung. Aber es zeigt auch ein Dilemma auf: Während der
&lt;a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2009/die-dreizehn-luegen-der-zensursula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zensursula-Debatte&lt;/a>
und den Anti-ACTA-Protesten wurde deutlich herausgestellt, dass es dem
Staat nicht zuzutrauen ist, zwischen guter und schlechter
Internetnutzung zu unterscheiden. Insbesondere nicht, ohne diese
Mittel zur politischen Einflussnahme zu missbrauchen. Ebenso sind
Vertraulichkeit der Kommunikation und freier Zugang zu
Verschlüsselungstechnologie stehende Forderungen der
Netzgemeinde. Jetzt aber wird genau diese Unterscheidung in gute und
schlechte Software vom Staat erwartet. Das Problem der Grenzziehung
bleibt dabei bestehen - was, wenn der Staat die Kontrolle digitaler
Rüstungsgüter zum Vorwand nimmt, die Verbreitung von
Verschlüsselungstechnik zu beschränken und damit Überwachung zu
ermöglichen?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Im netzpolitischen Diskurs ist dieser Konflikt noch nicht
zufriedenstellend aufgelöst. Es ist eine berechtigte Forderung, die
Verbreitung jeglicher Art von Mitteln, die zur Einschränkung von
Menschenrechten eingesetzt werden zu kontrollieren und möglichst zu
verhindern. Es ist besonders eklig und mit dem Gerechtigkeitsempfinden
in Deutschland nicht vereinbar, die Verbreitung digitaler
Rüstungsgüter darüber hinaus noch mit Steuergeldern zu fördern. Die
Bundesregierung ist aufgefordert, derartige Praxis zu unterbinden -
wirtschaftliche Interessen dürfen nicht über die Einhaltung der
Menschenrechte gestellt werden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Andererseits wird hier auch in der Netzpolitik deutlich, dass jede
Freiheit ihre Grenzen an der Freiheit der anderen findet, und es
deswegen hundertprozentige Freiheit nicht geben kann. Wenn die
Durchsetzung von Freiheiten zur &amp;ldquo;Freiheit&amp;rdquo; von Schutz und Sicherheit
führt, geht sie zu weit. Das an sich gesunde Misstrauen gegenüber der
Kontrolle durch den Staat darf nicht dazu führen, dass dieser keine
Massnahmen zur Gewährleistung der Grundrechte mehr implementieren
kann.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vielleicht können zwei weitere Mittel bei der Lösung des Problems
helfen: Freie Software, und Freie Netze. Die Kontrolle der Verbreitung
von Software steht ohnehin auf tönernen Füssen, da sie auf das eigene
Hoheitsgebiet beschränkt ist. Den Unterdrückten ist mehr geholfen,
wenn ihnen wirksame Mittel zur Gegenwehr zur Verfügung stehen. Durch
Freie Software wird es ihnen ermöglicht, vertrauenswürdigere Systeme
aufzubauen, bei denen es schwerer ist, Überwachungssysteme zum
Beispiel bereits durch den Hersteller zu installieren. Freie
Peer-to-Peer-Netztechnologie erlaubt den Aufbau von &amp;ldquo;Samisdat&amp;rdquo;-Netzen,
welche die &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great
Firewall&lt;/a>
aushebeln. Auf diese Art erlangen Initiativen wie Freifunk eine
politische Bedeutung als Mittel gegen Unterdrückung und Überwachung.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Das Bedürfnis des Schutzes der Schwachen wird zum Prüfstein der
Freiheitsforderungen in der Netzpolitik und zeigt auf, wie kleinlich
die Diskussion um den &amp;ldquo;Klau&amp;rdquo; von Musikstücken durch Kinder ist.&lt;/p>

Oil Contracts - How to read and understand them
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Oil contracts determine the share of the oil revenue that the country
who owns the oil, the international oil companies and others
receive. From the book: &amp;ldquo;It is petroleum contracts that express how
[the] money is split and who makes what profits, just as it is the
contracts that determine who manages operations and how issues such as
the environment, local economic development, and community rights are
dealt with. The share price of ExxonMobil, the question of who carries
responsibility for Deepwater Horizon, whether Uganda will be able to
stop importing petrol, and how much it costs to heat and light homes
in millions of homes ­­ these are issues which depend directly on
clauses in the contracts signed between the governments of the world
and the oil companies. For most of the 150 years of oil production,
these contracts have remained hidden, nested in a broader secrecy that
surrounded all aspects of the industry. Governments claimed national
security prerogatives, companies said commercial sensitivity precluded
making them available.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>People who have attended an Open Source develoment sprint may notice
that the desk in the picture pretty much looks like at one of them. A
book sprint applies techniques and tools developed in the Open Source
world to authoring. Gather the relevant people, get them to a remote
location with little distraction, and then allow them to focus on
producing something they are passionate about. As in software, the
results are impressive. Collaborative editing tools are used to
coordinate between authors, editors and illustrators, similar to
version control. It is also noteworthy that of the different expert
that attended the sprint, all attended on a pro-bono basis or as part
of their day job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://openoil.net/portfolio/oil-contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;How to understand an oil contract&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> book
is a good read even for people who are only casually interested in the
politics of oil. How the book was produced serves as a great example
of the Open Source way adopted by other, less technology related
sectors. And if the book contributes to making oil contracts better
understood and more comparable, the world has just become a better
place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#nk12 - Recht auf Zugang, Netzneutralität, informationelle Selbstbestimmung</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-11-05-nk12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-11-05-nk12/</guid><description>&lt;p>Von Netzpolitikaktivisten wird regelmäßig angenommen, sie wären strikt
gegen Regulierung im Internet, denn es gilt die anarchistische
Hackerkultur hochzuhalten. Als die grüne Bundestagsfraktion einlud,
beim &lt;a href="https://www.gruen-digital.de/2012/10/das-war-der-2-netzpolitischer-kongress-ein-gesellschaftsvertrag-fuer-das-digitale-zeitalter-im-bundestag-nk12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12. Netzpolitischen Kongress der
Grünen&lt;/a>
Beiträge zum angestrebten Digitalen Gesellschaftsvertrag einzubringen,
habe ich daher die Gelegenheit ergriffen zu präsentieren, warum
Netzpolitik notwendig Regulierung bedeutet, und weshalb es das
gegenwärtige Rumgedoktore an Symptomen zu überwinden gilt. Naturgemäß
ging es vorrangig um Freie Software, die Ökonomie des Internets,
kreative Zerstörung und die digitale Gesellschaft. So ist hoffentlich
für jeden was dabei. Der Beitrag ist zugegebenermassen etwas länglich,
weil er sich am Inhalt des Workshops orientiert.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Das Internet bewirkt vor allem eine Veränderung im Umgang mit
Informationen - sie sind jederzeit verfügbar, von zunehmend hoher
Qualität, und es können wesentlich mehr Informationen in der gleicher
Zeit verarbeitet werden. Was bedeuten diese technischen
Offensichtlichkeiten für das Wirtschaften? Dazu ist es notwendig, sich
Voraussetzungen für das Funktionieren des neoklassischen Marktmodells
zu vergegenwärtigen - vollkommene Information, viele uniforme
Marktteilnehmer und eine hohe Anzahl von Transaktionen. Diejenigen
Märkte, für welche die im Internet verfügbaren Informationen relevant
sind, werden also effizienter - Transaktionen können schneller und zu
geringeren Kosten abgewickelt werden und es ist leichter, sich
umfassend zu informieren und dadurch bessere Entscheidungen zu
treffen. Diese durch das Internet induzierte verbesserte Effizienz der
Märkte ist eine der Ursachen sowohl für das Gefühl des Agierens auf
Augenhöhe des Netzbürgers untereinander als auch für das Wegbrechen
von warmen Nischen, in denen sich Anbieter komfortabel breitgemacht
hatten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Das Internet ist das Medium, in dem sich Akteure und Informationen
tummeln. Freie Software ist das Werkzeug, dass sie
zusammenbringt. Ohne sowohl freie als auch kostenlos verfügbare
Produktionsmittel würde das Internet nicht annähernd die Akzeptanz und
insbesondere die wehrhafte Unterstützung erfahren, die gerade sichtbar
wird (siehe ACTA). Durch diese einladende Ausgangssituation werden
Internetnutzer gleichzeitig zu Produzenten und Konsumenten. Dieses
Prinzip war zu Pionierzeiten noch deutlicher - einer der frühen
Kritikpunkte an den heute üblichen asymmetrisch schnellen
Internetzugängen war, dass dadurch die dezentrale
Peer-to-Peer-Struktur des Internet untergraben wird. Obwohl weniger
prominent, wirkt dieses Prinzip aber noch heute, und nicht nur bei
Journalismus, Musik und Photographie, wo Nutzer originär an der
Erstellung der Produkte beteiligt sind. Auch unterschwelliger sind wir
alle Produzenten: in soziale Netzwerken dokumentieren wir die
Beziehungen zwischen allen möglichen Aspekten des Lebens (und machen
sie dadurch ökonomisch verwertbar, durch wen auch immer), und durch
Bewertungen übernehmen wir die Filterung der verfügbaren Daten nach
Relevanz und Qualität. Diese Metainformationen sind nicht weniger
wichtig wie die ursprünglichen, auf die sie verweisen, was daran
deutlich wird, dass die Geschäftsmodelle grosser Unternehmen wie
Twitter darauf aufbauen diese zu sammeln. Insgesamt sind nicht nur
ausgesprochen niedrige Barrieren zu überwinden, um selbst mit zu
produzieren, es wird darüber hinaus aktiv darum geworben - nicht
zuletzt, weil der Wert dieser riesigen Datenmengen nicht vorrangig dem
Nutzer, sondern den dominanten Datensammlern im Netz zu Gute
kommt. Jedenfalls ist das &lt;em>Read/Write Internet&lt;/em> das Ergebnis, eine
Gemeinschaft, in der die Unterscheidung von Produzent und Konsument
schwerer wird und sich deshalb Regulierung nicht mehr so schön mit den
jeweils Betroffenen einzeln verkungeln lässt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wat dem eenen sin Uhl, is dem anneren sin Nachtigal. Effizientere
Märkte bedeuten vor allem mehr Wettbewerb und damit mehr
Anpassungsdruck, mehr kreative Zerstörung. Jedes neue Produkt ersetzt
ein vorheriges, so das es nicht verwunderlich ist, dass sich all
diesen neuen Entwicklungen massiver Widerstand entgegenstellt mit dem
Ziel, diese wenn nicht ganz zu verhindern, dann doch anständig zu
verlangsamen. Wenn wir heute Filmkritiken aus dem Kinosaal
verschicken, schadet das nicht nur dem Umsatz von schlechten Schinken,
es bleiben auch Berufskinokritiker auf der Strecke, deren Meinung auf
einmal kaum noch einen Kinogänger interessiert. Es geht aber auch
ernsthafter - (Mikro-) Blogging aus politischen Krisengebieten ersetzt
Vor-Ort-Journalismus und ist gleichzeitig schneller und
authentischer. Produktbewertungen durch Kunden konkurrieren um die
Deutungshoheit etablierter Produkttester, weshalb sie auch gern
manipuliert werden - die Stiftung Warentest fährt dieses Jahr zum
ersten Mal einen Verlust ein. Auch das ist Teil der digitalen
Gesellschaft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eine Institution ist ein Regelsystem, welches eine bestimmte soziale
Ordnung hervorruft, sagt
&lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia&lt;/a>. Dieser recht
weit gefasste Begriff umfasst nahezu alles, woran wir uns gewöhnt
haben, insbesondere formelle und informelle Institutionen - Ämter,
Vereine, Unternehmen, aber auch das System der Berufsausbildung und
die Repräsentanten der Zivilgesellschaft. Woher aber kommen die Regeln
für das Regelsystem? Sie entstehen organisch aus dem Umfeld, den
Interessen und Aktivitäten der Beteiligten, und erwachsen zur
Norm. Oft bewirken sie den Ausgleich von sozialen
Interessenkonflikten, oder dienen als Fokalpunkt der
Willensbildung. Die Kombination von Internet und Freier Software
verändert dieses Umfeld schlagartig (zumindest aus historischer
Perspektive), und zwingt dadurch alle betroffenen Institutionen (also
praktisch alle) zur Adaption. Obwohl Institutionen aber entstehen,
wenn Menschen zusammenarbeiten für ein gemeinsames Ziel, entwickeln
sie ein Eigenleben. Sie überdauern nicht nur oft ihre Nützlichkeit,
sie verwechseln auch oft ihre konkrete Aufgabe mit der Zeit mit ihrem
Daseinsgrund. Passen sie sich nicht effizient genug an, werden sie vom
formenden Korsett zur Zwangsjacke. Es ist nicht so, dass sich
Institutionen nicht auch weiterentwickeln. Die Anpassung ist aber ein
langsamer, vom Leidensdruck getriebener Prozess, der oft genug vom
Widerstand gegen notwendige Veränderungen geprägt ist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ein paar Beispiele mögen das verdeutlichen. Verfassungsorgane sind
natürlich prominente Institutionen, bei denen wir uns deutlich bewusst
sind, wie sie durch ihr Umfeld geprägt wurden und sich
entwickelten. Unser System der repräsentativen Demokratie ist
wesentlich von der Annahme beeinflusst, dass es notwendig ist, wenige
Repräsentanten auszuwählen, die dann im Namen aller temporär
regieren. Dies ist deswegen notwendig, weil es nicht möglich ist, den
Bürger vor jeder einzelnen Entscheidung zu seine Meinung zu
befragen. Ist das wirklich noch so? Die Piratenbewegung ist
entstanden, weil mit dem Internet die Möglichkeiten der politischen
Beteiligung umfassender geworden sind - die einzelne Befragung ist nur
einen Klick entfernt, die Kosten sind zu vernachlässigen. Der
bestehende Prozess der politischen Willensbildung wirkt veraltet, es
entsteht Anpassungsdruck. Trotzdem ist aber zu erwarten, dass
(Berufs-)Politiker und Verwaltung weiterhin vor der drohenden Unbill
von direkter Demokratie und Volksentscheiden warnen. Völlig
uneigennützig, oder als Teil der von Veränderung bedrohten
Institutionen?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freie Software und Peer Production, das Modell, in dem Menschen
gemeinsam, kollaborativ an der Erstellung von Gemeingütern arbeiten,
bieten eine Alternative zur sonst üblichen Produktion durch
Unternehmen oder den Staat. Das Internet ermöglicht eine weitreichende
Arbeitsteilung und erleichtert die Koordination, das Zusammensetzen
der vielen kleinen Contributions zu einem Ganzen. Dabei setzt der
Austausch von Leistungen nicht auf Geld auf, so dass Preisfindung
zumindest keine zentrale Rolle spielt. Das Mitwirken wird oft
vorrangig als sinnstiftend betrachtet und ist intrinsisch
motiviert. Behörden und Unternehmen sind die klassische Alternative
zur Community, aber nur, weil es selbst bei Gemeingütern keine
Alternativen gab. Und so bemühen sie sich zu begründen, warum trotzdem
Schulbücher kein Gemeingut sein sollen, warum ein Leistungsschutzrecht
die Verbreitung von Informationen mehr fördert als offenes Berichten
im Netz, warum offener Zugang zu Nahverkehrsdaten doch keinen Nutzen
stiftet, und so weiter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sehr spannend steht es um die Institution der professionellen
Ausbildung, vom Beruf bis zum Studium. Schon länger steht sie in
Konkurrenz mit dem fortlaufenden lebenslangen Lernen. Mit der
wachsenden Bedeutung der professionellen Reputation im Internet sieht
sie sich einer entscheidenden Herausforderung gegenüber. Ein
Facharbeiterbrief oder ein Diplom sind nichts weiter als verbriefte
Reputation, noch dazu statisch. Sie repräsentieren nur unzureichend
den tatsächlichen Erfahrungsschatz einer Person. Dieser aber wird
zunehmend genauer durch deren digitales Bild im Internet bestimmt, bei
Köchen durch Restaurantbewertungen, bei Handwerkern und
Versandhändlern durch Käuferfeedback, bei Bloggern durch die Anzahl
Followers, bei Experten durch deren LinkedIn-Endorsements und
-Empfehlungen. Ist ein Blogger mit grosser Gefolgschaft ein besserer
oder schlechterer Berichterstatter als ein Absolvent der
Journalistenschule ohne solche? &amp;ldquo;Show me the code&amp;rdquo; lautet ein Motto
der modernen Arbeitswelt, und verdeutlicht eine neue Kultur der
Schaffenden: Reputation statt Jobtitel, Ergebnisse statt Anzug. Nicht
umsonst findet sich Widerstand dagegen insbesondere von denen, deren
verbriefte Reputation besonders wertvoll erscheint -

überraschend gegen Forderungen nach Open Access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Die Politik findet sich in der Rolle wieder, den aufgezeigten Konflikt
zwischen der Freiheit des einzelnen Produ-Konsumenten und dem (positiv
ausgedrückt) den Wandel gestaltenden Lobbyismus der etablierten
Institutionen durch Regulierung aufzulösen. Während der BDI noch
erklärt, das &lt;a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2012/der-tag-des-geistigen-eigentums-beim-bdi-die-nachlese-aus-der-sicht-der-fsfe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet wäre Marktplatz und nicht öffentlicher
Raum&lt;/a>,
um damit Sperrforderungen bei Urheberrechtsverletzungen durchzusetzen,
sind sich Politiker zunehmend bewusst, im Netz den (virtuellen)
öffentlichen Raum der Zukunft zu sehen, den Raum, im dem sich der
politische Willensbildungsprozess abspielt. Gestalten oder Erhalten
wird damit zur zentralen Frage der Netzpolitik. Gestalten der
errungenen Freiheiten des Netzbürgers, insbesondere von Freiheiten
definiert als Abwesenheit von Zwang oder Missbrauch, oder Erhalten von
bestehenden Institutionen, auch wenn dies bedeutet, dem Bürger zur
Teilnahme zu zwingen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sicherlich liegt die Wahrheit irgendwo in der Mitte zwischen Erhalten
und Gestalten, im Ausgleich von Interessen. Will man einen länger als
eine Wahlperiode gültigen Gesellschaftsvertrag für das Digitale
Zeitalter erarbeiten, dann kann dieser Ausgleich nicht erreicht
werden, in dem Symptome kuriert (das Kopieren verhindert, der Provider
haftbar gemacht, das Umgehen von DRM-Massnahmen verboten)
werden. Statt dessen sollten dauerhaftere Prinzipien zum Kern eines
solchen Vertrags werden. Die Minimierung und transparente Legitimation
von Zwang als Trade-Off zwischen dem öffentlichen und dem Interesse
des Einzelnen sind dabei von zentraler Bedeutung. Drei dieser
Prinzipien sollten sein:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Recht auf Zugang zum Internet&lt;/em>: Wenn das Internet ein öffentlicher
Raum ist, kann dem Bürger der Zugang nicht auf Grund von Grundrechten
nachgeordneten Gesetzen entzogen werden, der Massnahme fehlte die
Verhältnismässigkeit. Umgekehrt bedeutet das Recht auf Zugang auch,
dass es hoheitliche Aufgabe ist, jedem Bürger Zugang zu ermöglichen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Netzneutralität&lt;/em>: Mit Zensur kann kein Prozess der politischen
Willensbildung funktionieren. Bürger brauchen die Sicht auf das &amp;ldquo;echte
Netz&amp;rdquo;. Neutralität, der ungefilterte, nicht diskriminierende Zugang
zum Internet, muss die Norm sein.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Recht auf informationelle Selbstbestimmung&lt;/em>: Das virtuelle Bild
des Ichs bestimmt dauerhaft die persönliche Reputation, das eigene
Erscheinungsbild. Die Kontrolle des Bürgers über seine öffentlich
bereitgestellten Daten ist wesentliche Voraussetzung für einen zivilen
Umgang miteinander. Davon leiten sich Forderungen nach
(durchsetzbaren) Löschoptionen, nach interoperablem Export und Import
zwischen Diensten und nach Gerätehoheit, also nach selbstbestimmter
Verwendung der Geräte ab.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Letztlich bedeuten alle diese Entwicklungen einen Übergang von der
technischen Umwälzung Internet zum Internet im Alltag, bei dem
Vernetzung Normalität ist, und die Anwendungen des Vernetztseins im
Vordergrund steht. Die digitale Bürgerbewegung setzt sich also
deutlich nicht gegen Regulierung ein, sondern für einen
Gesellschaftsvertrag im Digitalen Zeitalter, der auf Prinzipien
basierende Rahmenbedingungen für das Leben im Netz für Netzbürger und
Institutionen schafft.&lt;/p>

question -
&lt;a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Can-open-source-be-democratic-1663702.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Can Open Source be democratic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> He
describes how Free Software emerged as a distributed, bottom-up system
of writing code. The central defining aspects of that culture are a
uniquely open process not just of programming but also of its
organization, and a close relationship between programmers and
users. Effectively, users and programmers together were both
contributors, they collaborated on the project. Glyn goes on to
explain how this community effort changed over time to become more
institutionalized, more corporate and more dull - &amp;ldquo;becoming a &amp;lsquo;Firefox
Affiliate&amp;rsquo;, hardly something that sets the pulse racing.&amp;rdquo; Ordinary
users no longer play an important part in Open Source projects.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
For Aristotle the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy the citizens can have a share in freedom.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Underlying is the assumption that Open Source is democratic, and this
assumption needs to be questioned. Open Source communities have been
coined to be self-directed, meritocratic,  &amp;hellip;, but it is rarely
emphasized that they are democratic. Since individuals are investing
effort in their favorite projects to contribute to something greater,
and democracy is commonly considered to be a greater good as well, it
is intriguing to make the jump to thinking of Open Source communities
as being democratic. But are they? What is the meaning of democracy in
the context of Open Source? What does a democratic community look
like?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some may say that such political concepts cannot easily be transferred
to how Open Source communities should function. While it may not be
easy, it is still worthwhile - democracies have dealt with similar
problems of inclusion and the distribution of power and
responsibility. Just like democratic states, communities are volunteer
organizations that congregate to build the public goods they desire in
the commons. Just like citizens, members of communities have a choice
of voice or exit that they make based on the expected influence they
have as citizens. There are enough similarities to justify learning by
example.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="on-being-a-contributor">On being a contributor&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Democracy means &amp;ldquo;rule of the people&amp;rdquo;, and postulates, amongst other
things, for each individual to be equal before the law and to have a
vote in the political process and election of the government. This
immediately boils down to the central Yin-Yang question of who is a
citizen and who is not. Are users considered integral parts (citizens)
of the Open Source communities, or outsiders who provide feedback? And
should they be the equals of developers?  While today we seem to think
that equality comes standard, it is in fact a dynamic concept, its
meaning changes with culture. Think about the Voting Rights Act of
1965 that finally abolished voter&amp;rsquo;s discrimination by race in the US,
or the fact that women will gain the right to vote in Saudi Arabia in
the year 2015. This is what Glyn observes - users changed from being
integral elements of the community to playing an only marginal role,
akin to not having a vote.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eligibility and acceptance are what discerns citizens from barbarians
and slaves. Eligibility answers the question of which individuals can
potentially become citizens. Acceptance is the requirements an
eligible individual has to fulfill to gain citizenship. For example, a
foreigner living in a country may be eligible for citizenship, but to
be accepted needs to pay taxes for a number of years. When the same
questions are applied to Open Source communities, they translate to
&amp;ldquo;Who is a contributor and could thus become a citizen of our
community? How does somebody join the project?&amp;rdquo; and second, &amp;ldquo;What
does a newcomer have to do to be considered a contributor, a part of
the community?&amp;rdquo; (does that sound like &amp;ldquo;How do I become a committer&amp;rdquo;? -
exactly). In Open Source communities usually all individuals are
eligible to join, but to be accepted and integrated, they need to
&lt;em>contribute to the code&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So for users to become integral parts of Open Source communities
again, users that engage with an Open Source project need to be equal
contributors amongst peers, to be eligible. This is far from standard,
and not the mind-set of most contributors I know. Most communities I
work with value direct contributions to the project source code higher
than feedback from users. They (unconsciously?) consider users
outsiders and refer them to talk to the issue tracker, a proven way to
make sure they never come back again with more feedback. So firstly,
users need to be considered eligible to become community members, and
second their efforts (feedback, for example) need to qualify them for
acceptance as ordinary contributors.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="on-open-governance">On Open Governance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>But not all communities are created equal. When evaluating how
democratic a community is, we need to look at their reason to
exist. Not all Open Source projects are created by developers and
users together, and the distribution of power and responsibility
usually follows this outset goal or doctrine. If a project that is
founded by developers and users  grows organically into an openly
governed community (like KDE), it is likened to a democracy. A project
that is founded by a company (think Mozilla or Qt) and maybe allows
external contributors in along as they accept the decrees^wCLA of the
king^wowner company aches more towards an aristocracy. Not all
contributors are equals, and the ruling government cannot be replaced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There has been a long debate over what the most central trait of a
democracy is. Opinions differ, but there is one question - can the
citizens, on a regular basis, re-elect or replace the ruling
government in a structured process, without the need for a revolution?
With this argument in mind, it becomes apparent that not all Open
Source communities are democratic. KDE is to an extend, with a weak
government and regular elections where every active member has exactly
one vote. Think about electing a new government for Android, and the
difference becomes apparent. Of the Open Source projects Glyn
mentioned in his post, few can be considered democratic by this
standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back to the question on how to reduce the distance between users and
developers and how to build communities that thrive on
collaboration. Users, like any contributor, will consider the effect
their investment of time into the project will have. If the utility
they gain from contributing outweighs the cost of the effort to
contribute, they will join the community and help with the
project. The utility is directly related to the openness of the
community governance; it will be less if the contributor&amp;rsquo;s influence
is only on mundane details, and greater if she has the chance to
become the next president of KDE e.V. This emphasizes the importance
of Open Governance for the longevity and community spirit of Open
Source projects. Only with both the Open Source way and Open
Governance, the user experiences the freedom to create that convinces
her to join the project. Democracy in communities is Open Source
combined with Open Governance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>From the status of being a contributor - a citizen - follows
the
&lt;a href="https://endocode.com/blog/2012/03/16/managing-trust-in-mixed-commercial-and-volunteer-open-source-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right and duty&lt;/a> to
take part in the community&amp;rsquo;s affairs. Open Source can be democratic if
it treats all the community members equally. Three requirements for
considering an Open Source community democratic have been developed in
the discussion above:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>To be democratic requires not to discriminate amongst contributors
(users and developers). Users are contributors. They need to be
encouraged to join the community, to give feedback and to otherwise
help improve the project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Demmocracy in communities means Open Source combined with Open
Governance. The availability of the source code under a Free
Software license is not sufficient for an Open Source community to
be democratic. Without equality, without the contributors
controlling the project as equals, it may be Open Source, but it is
not democratic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Governance is open if the contributors are equals and the community
elects its own representation. Defining Open Governance as the
situation where the contributors are in control of their project on
all levels, democracy in an Open Source project can only be achieved
when all contributors have equal say on all matters of the project.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Whether or not contributors fully are equals amongst peers can only be
decided by actions, not by words. The ethical question whether or not
democracy is desirable for an Open Source project has been avoided in
this article. In my personal opinion, Glyn is absolutely right: For
Open Source to continue being successful, direct and indirect
contributors need to get back to working together. With the widening
appeal of Open Source software, naturally developers will become more
experienced and professional, and the average user will turn to be
less technical and computer savvy. This trend will likely continue
with the growing user base of Open Source. And because it is
inevitable, Open Source projects should instead prepare to liaise more
with users and generally get good at integrating users and coders in
the community.&lt;/p>

of the announcement of Nokia&amp;rsquo;s platform strategy change. Rationality
often goes out of the window when people feel such a change goes
against their personal values or beliefs. In the past days, I worked
on an analysis of the impact of the changes on KDAB, Qt and the Free
Software communities we work with, especially KDE. KDAB is rooted
deeply in the KDE community, and many of our developers work with Qt
and KDE for years now. We are sharing the same worries and hopes, so
the results may be interesting for others as well. This post is about
Qt, KDE, Free Software, politics, devices, markets, strategies - it
does not get much better than that. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="be-thankful-for-what-you-got">Be thankful for what you got&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are told to judge by actions, not by words, so let us have a look
at the development of Qt since Nokia bought Trolltech, and how the KDE
community benefitted from it. It is important to stress this up front
because it is easy to forget that since then, Nokia has been a very
important benefactor. KDE is based on Qt and always relied heavily
it&amp;rsquo;s technical advances. Trolltech convinced many developers to use Qt
because of it&amp;rsquo;s superior quality and ease of use and the friendly and
inspiring developer community. But it was a small company, and could
not have afforded to forgo the license revenue made from selling
commercial Qt licenses. This revenue was the central pillar of
Trolltech&amp;rsquo;s business model. Trolltech was also in the uneasy situation
that it influenced the software industry way more than it&amp;rsquo;s small size
warranted, and attracted the attention of much larger
competitors. With the takeover, the revenue Trolltech generated was to
a large extend irrelevant to Nokia. The development framework is a
strategic asset, and selling Qt licenses is not in line with Nokia&amp;rsquo;s
core competencies. It also made perfect business sense to invest even
more resources that could never have been afforded from the license
revenue, to be able to rely on Qt as the future UI platform. This
investment resulted in huge performance improvements, new technologies
like QML, a continuous stable development process with many releases,
Qt Creator, and many other goodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the biggest gift Nokia ever presented us with was to relicense Qt
under the LGPL. It finally overcame the acceptance issue with Qt in
the wider Free Software space, and helped grow the Qt user base
massively. While other important safeguards like the Free Qt
Foundation were already in place, using Qt under the LGPL license is
so much less of a hurdle to take then to enforce the rights granted
through the Free Qt Foundation. Those rights can also only be executed
once, and only as an action of last resort. Without Qt under LGPL,
MeeGo would not have been accepted by the software industry. This, the
public hosting of the Qt git repo and the massive development manpower
Nokia invested in Qt benefit KDE immensely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best part is that none of these presents can be un-given or taken
away. Qt is there to stay under the current Free Software licenses,
and the quality it gained in the recent years will also remain at
KDE&amp;rsquo;s service. There are new developments in KDE like QML and QtQuick
that KDE still has to fully make use of. Today&amp;rsquo;s Qt is a superb
platform to base the development of KDE on in the coming
years. Thanks, Nokia.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="qt">Qt&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is an open question how these past achievements translate into the
future when it comes to Qt&amp;rsquo;s own development. From talking to business
partners and contacts at Nokia, it is pretty clear that no new
direction has been set for the Qt unit at Nokia. The announcement that
there will be no layoffs or budget cuts is comforting, but it needs to
be taken with a grain of salt. It may have all kinds of reasons, for
example personnel retention, local labor laws, maintaining an
undamaged business unit that can be sold - or the simple lack of an
updated strategy. So all these statements have to be mentally extended
with an &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;until further notice&amp;rdquo;. By definition, strategy changes do
not occur on a regular basis. Even if the Microsoft partnership is
unsuccessful (in sales figures, for example), it will take 3 to 5
years for that to be realized and the strategy to be re-evaluated. In
that time frame, there will most certainly be changes to the Qt unit
if it remains within Nokia.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="checking-the-facts-about-nokia-platforms-shipping-qt">Checking the facts about Nokia platforms shipping Qt&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Nokia plans to ship another 150 million Symbian devices with Qt
installed. The ability to do so depends heavily on the appeal of these
phones to users willing to pay more than the magical 100 Euro barrier
price. A vivid app market is necessary to reach this goal, since apps
are a major sales driver in today&amp;rsquo;s smartphones. Will companies keep
investing in the fledgling Symbian plus Qt app space? Investors shy
away from shrinking markets. Every corporate strategist tasked with
developing a product-market-matrix will put anything Symbian related
into the &amp;ldquo;de-invest&amp;rdquo; bracket. Why does the Symbian market shrink? Have
a look at the diagram that visualizes the spectrum of Nokia phones
(while creating the image I discovered how close the Qt and the
Windows Phone 7 shades of green are - a coincidence? I guess we will
never know).&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
The Nokia Qt Dilemma
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The lower end S30/S40 devices are becoming more attractive because
features are added to them that so far required a smart
phone. Internet access becomes more and more pervasive, and apps are
being developed for these devices now. Having a Facebook app, for
example, will be a convincing argument for those buyers who never
really wanted a clunky smartphone. Also, these not-so-dumb phones will
continue to be developed and shipped under the new strategy, resulting
in better customer acceptance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through constantly improving hardware, the smartphones are being sold
at steadily decreasing prices. The cheapest Android phones are now at
below 100 Euro. This puts additional pressure on the sales revenue
generated by the current high-end Symbian phones. Customer acceptance
plays an important role in this segment as well. Read the latest
tweets, and half of them are in the line of &amp;ldquo;I finally got rid of my
Nokia and got an Android phone now&amp;rdquo;. Customers will shy away from a
line of phones that is already announced to be replaced. It is like
beating the proverbial dead horse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the Symbian market segment will shrink, and with that the
importance (and clout) of Qt within Nokia. Customers do not care about
mobile OSes to a large extend. As soon as an average S40 phone will
ship apps and have internet access, the middle bracket in the above
diagram will fade away. Nokia is trying to define a &amp;ldquo;mid range phone&amp;rdquo;
segment between the feature phones (S30/S40) and the smartphone (WP7)
ranges. This segment is not established in the phone market, and it is
questionable whether there will be a niche for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of that, app developers will hesitate to invest in the
platform, and the Qt mobile ecosystem will be under a lot of
pressure. In all the Nokia devices, Qt will not gain the widest
coverage of all development platforms. Very likely it will be S30/S40,
by device count, and WP7, by sales volume. Remember this is about Qt
within Nokia. It only influences KDE indirectly, by defining Qt&amp;rsquo;s role
in the platform strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="qt-on-other-mobile-platforms">Qt on other Mobile Platforms&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With apps currently being developed in Java for the S30/S40 based
phones, Nokia uses 3 different development platforms for it&amp;rsquo;s phone
lineup, Java, Symbian with Qt, and WP7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a hopelessly romantic rumor that Qt support might come for
the S30/S40 platform. A reality check is needed here. The low-end
devices are shipping with S30/S40 because it is available today, not
because it is a great modern future-proof platform. The apps for these
phones are being developed now, or within the next twelve months. Even
if a full-scale Qt port is started today, it won&amp;rsquo;t be available
short-term. No doubt the Qt community will be able to pull off that
stunt. But finishing the port is one thing, getting it through quality
acceptance and to the point where it is shipped in devices is
another. App developers would only target those devices when they
gained a sufficient market share, and by that time, an Android phone
sells for 50 Euro. Because of that, I do not think there will be an
official strategy to make Qt available on S30/S40. And since Qt is
also not coming to to WP7, Qt&amp;rsquo;s cross platform claim is moot within
Nokia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the Qt ports to Androids, Blackberries, Badas and Kindles become a
viable reality, other vendors will sell more devices supporting Qt
than Nokia. And that is a development going on now, while Nokia will
need between one and two years to release the first WP7 phone. These
forces will heavily impede Nokia&amp;rsquo;s ability to differentiate based on
the features of Qt, and result in less motivation to base a future
strategy on Qt as a disruptive technology. The disruption will happen
while Nokia is developing it&amp;rsquo;s first WP7 phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-governance-of-qt">Open Governance of Qt&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Regarding Open Governance, it is another open question if this strategy is
viable for Qt in the absence of a major investor (of time and money)
that drives the development. There is a good chance that it ends up
like XFree.org and produces little more than bike shedding for a long
time. Free Software projects under Open Governance, like the Linux
kernel, or X.org, or - not quite the same, but very similar - the C++
standard, tend to innovate slowly. Because of that, I am not convinced
that an impressive Qt 5 can be developed by the community under Open
Governance in a reasonable time frame. Do not get this wrong: The idea
is great, the problem is that it might not work out as we all hope
for. Three major scenarios come to mind when thinking about the future
of Qt&amp;rsquo;s governance:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Nokia considers Qt a strategic asset, and continues to heavily
invest in it. In this case, Open Governance has a chance to
succeed, but might not be in Nokia&amp;rsquo;s own interest, since it will be
losing control over it&amp;rsquo;s own important technology.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qt is switched into maintenance mode, because it is not seen as
important for the future. In this case, Open Governance will have a
hard time to be implemented in the first place, and partners will
hesitate to take responsibility for individual modules.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nokia plans to sell the Qt unit as an asset. In this case, the
potential buyer will want enforceable control over it&amp;rsquo;s
investment. For that plan, Open Governance devalues Qt as a
sellable product. The biggest challenge for the transition to Open
Governance is to make sure the companies invested in Qt support it
fully, and want to see it happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Maybe I missed a scenario that will make it work? Please post your
feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest challenge for Qt itself will be the potential talent
drain. Qt attracted excellent developers from all over the world
because it was innovative and elite. Those are people that won&amp;rsquo;t be
comfortable with being parked on the back burner, and might not feel
at home with Nokia anymore. At the same time, they do not exactly have
problems finding another job. It will be hard for Nokia to convince
employees not to leave, and also to hire new talent of the same
quality. This is a long-term threat to the quality of Qt, and it&amp;rsquo;s
ability to innovate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="countering-the-threat-of-free-software-in-the-mobile-market">Countering the &amp;ldquo;threat&amp;rdquo; of Free Software in the mobile market&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Android based devices and Nokia smartphones together make up 64% of
the global smartphone market at the time of this writing, according to
Wikipedia (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone)&lt;/a>. If Nokia would
have successfully transitioned to a MeeGo based smartphone line with
Qt GUIs, the majority of the mobile devices market would use Free
Software based development tools, on open and inviting ecosystems for
developers, a competitive app market with low entry barriers, all in
all promising innovation and affordable devices. Nokia was looking for
a solution for it&amp;rsquo;s future platform problem, and it was determined to
base it on Free Software. The stock market loved the idea. Google
agreed, too, and made Android.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, market demand for Windows based phones is at an
overall low. There is simply no need for another closed proprietary
phone OS, considering the alternatives. The tendency of it becoming an
accepted standard that phone software platforms should be based on
Free Software threatens Microsofts investment in WP7, and it&amp;rsquo;s general
position as a closed operating system vendor. WP7 was a solution
looking for a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is probably a large overlap of institutional investors in Nokia
and Microsoft, given that they are both market leaders and publicly
traded companies. Both companies see their markets under siege, and
are not doing very well, so it might have sounded like a good idea at
the time to combine the hardware vendor looking for a phone OS with
the phone OS vendor looking for hardware. The partnership is
unbalanced though, because if it fails, Microsoft will still be the
market leader in PC OS installations, and Nokia will have lost
relevance in the global smart phone market. The stock market did not
love that idea so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it is seriously hard to believe that simply pushing WP7 to the
market was Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s only motivation. Also, there are other vendors
that started offering WP7 phones. So why Nokia? There must be another
compelling reason for Microsoft to first send a top-ranking emissary
to Nokia, and then form a partnership that by all the usual criteria
looks like a takeover. This reason that was important enough for
Microsoft to invest billions into Nokia was to battle Free Software in
it&amp;rsquo;s emerging mobile market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The strategic goal of ensuring that future phone OSes are based on
proprietary and in particular not on Free Software was very likely the
major motivator for Microsoft to pursue this unequal partnership. The
recent ban of Free Software from the Microsoft app store indicates a
similar motivation. Nokia&amp;rsquo;s Free Software based platform strategy is
dead, and it will not come back. This means Microsoft achieved one
strategic goal immediately by establishing the partnership and
aborting Nokia&amp;rsquo;s Free Software based efforts. If this move was about
WP7 introduction into the market, why rely on the stumbling giant
Nokia, and not on one of the hungry Asian tigers, like HTC, who are
already offering WP7 phones? Because those did not have a Free
Software based strategy. Maemo or MeeGo together with Android are a
thought unbearable to Microsoft.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>About Qt - Qt was a compelling toolkit that developers loved to work
with before Nokia bought it. That is the real reason for it&amp;rsquo;s
success. Developers tell their managers that they want to use Qt
rather than something else. That quality of Qt has gotten even
better. This is why I think Qt will continue to be strong and - after
the shakeout happening now - to grow in both the Free Software and the
commercial development spaces. Qt reputation with decision makers has
been damaged, though. They regarded it not only as stable from a
software point of view, but also as being trustworthy from a
development process and maintenance point of view. This image has been
severely tarnished. So for now, the Qt market will shrink because
mobile users will leave, and it will recover and grow at a slower rate
afterwards due to the reduced willingness of developers and decision
makers to invest in it. The change of pace might be a good thing for
Qt itself after the recent coding marathons it went through. The
trolls will work hard on keeping Qt the best and one and only true
cross-platform UI toolkit on the planet. I wish them all the best for
the turbulent time to come. Hug a troll, everybody!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About KDE - KDE as a technology will not be affected much right
now. Qt is Free Software and does not change over night. There are
enough great new features that KDE still has to digest. Even the
longer term outlook of the strategy for Qt only has an indirect effect
on KDE. Not many developers joined KDE because of the prospect of Qt
on mobile phones, so even the community will remain stable. The
development focus of Qt becomes broader again, away from concentrating
on features for the mobile space. Whether Nokia will continue to
support KDE at the same scale as in the last years is mostly a PR
decision, so it is also not related to the more technical aspects
described above. It will depend on the friendly relationship that has
been developed so far, and how it continues. Nonetheless, the next KDE
version will be shipped on time. KDE is in good shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About Free Software - Nokia&amp;rsquo;s strategy change is a very sad
development in this regard, because it is not just about Qt. Microsoft
is trying to prevent Free Software from becoming mainstream in the
mobile space. Beside the feeling that it is already too late for that,
the process raises the question if such activity against the GNU
competition should be concerning the regulators. Antitrust and other
market law protects businesses from unfair competition, but
unfortunately it does not protect Free Software communities or
projects from being bullied. Indirectly preventing a competitor from
entering the market, for example, can be a reason for the antitrust
agencies to not approve such a partnership, but only if large
businesses are involved that are able to prevent the usual market
forces from working. This is a political issue, and needs to be
brought forward to policy makers. Our interests, those of Free
Software as a force to create better working and more competitive
markets, are not sufficiently represented there. That is why I will
join the FSFE.&lt;/p>
