This
software drives innovation and enables everybody to access and use
computers, whether or not they can afford new hardware or commercial
software. So that&amp;rsquo;s that, the benefit to society is obvious. Everybody
should just get behind it and support it. Right? Well, it is not that
easy. Especially when it comes to principles of individual freedom or
trade-offs between self-determination and convenience, it is difficult
to communicate the message in a way that it reaches and activates a
wider audience. How can we explain the difference between Free
Software and services available at no cost (except them spying at you)
best? Campaigning for software freedom is not easy. However, it is
part of the Free Software Foundation Europe&amp;rsquo;s mission. The FSFE teamed
up with &lt;a href="https://www.pen.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peng! Collective&lt;/a> to learn how to run
influential campaigns to promote the cause of Free Software. The Peng
Collective is a Berlin based group of activists who are known for
their successful and quite subversive campaigns for political
causes. And Endocode? Endocode is a sponsor of the Free Software
Foundation Europe. We are a sponsor because free software is essential
to us, both as a company and as members of society. And so here we
are.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Super secret conspiracy workshop
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>There are some exciting, courageous and engaging campaigns that focus
on communicating complex political
goals. The
&lt;a href="http://www.fluchthelfer.in/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">escape helpers campaign&lt;/a> leaves
the audience conflicted between the two choices of being a good human
rights activists (driven by ideals and demonstrating solidarity with
refugees) and being a good citizen (by abiding to the law). Great,
because the message is to re-think what is legal against what is
right. The
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At9rWPj7MzU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#slamshell performance&lt;/a>
emotionally demonstrated the risks associated with oil drilling that
are normally regarded as marginal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These campaigns translate abstract, distant risks or worries into
concrete, tangible calls to action. By being provocative, they break
the mold and reach a wide audience online and through
traditional media. They are &amp;ldquo;cat content for social change&amp;rdquo;, as our
tutors put it. Campaigners are being urged to stop preaching or
complaining and to start using positive communication combined with
subversive PR work instead. Such messaging needs punchlines, which
requires some kind of hyperbole - dadaism, hijacking attention, or
provocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Campaign development is still a pretty down to earth task. Through
fact finding research and the analysis of campaign goals, supporting
allies and potential opponents, answers to the four essential
questions are being narrowed down: What is the change that we want to
achieve? How can this change be brought about? Who can make that
change we want to see? And who has power over the involved people or
groups? Setting campaign goals is often a compromise between achieving
big changes locally or small changes &amp;ldquo;globally&amp;rdquo;. It helps to envision
the impact of the campaign through utopia/dystopia brainstorms: What
would a world look like where all campaign goals have been achieved
perfectly? What would it look like if everything went horribly wrong?
These kind of mental exercises also help to explain the relevance of
the campaign goals and show how the intended change can affect
people&amp;rsquo;s lives. The goals may be perfectly obvious to those passionate
about them already, but not to outsiders - a common problem regarding
the ethics and ideals of Free Software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implementing a campaign involves many standard, by the book project
management tasks. The individual publicity stunts and activities are
the actions that form the campaign timeline. A dilemma specific to the
FSFE is that the relevant and influential media - social networks
especially - are the kind of centralized proprietary platforms against
which we are advocating. However, we learned that it may be possible
to play this situation to our advantage :-) Since the FSFE&amp;rsquo;s goals
require some heavy lifting of Free Software lobbying, the campaign
timeline extends far into the future. We found ourselves thinking
about what to present at conferences a year or more into the
future. Finalizing the campaign plan involves answering the
&amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; question of what time, material and talent is required to
perform the tasks, and to put them into a timeline. Often this
includes outside help for extra manpower or professional
expertise. Noticeably, those with technical backgrounds tend to haste
towards a release, underestimating the lead time required to get
there, and the duration of the campaign. This tendency works almost,
but not quite, entirely unlike in software projects. Securing and
confirming the support of allies and protagonists also takes time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The planned actions need to be reviewed with a focus group that
resembles or at least understands the target audience. This review
should confirm that the message conveyed is in fact understandable and
makes sense. It is not possible to get a clear answer on whether or
not a campaign project needs an ultimate decision maker. The answer
depends too much on the composition of the campaign team and the
timeline of the project. The necessary communication infrastructure is
pretty straightforward - tasks boards, and instead and asynchronous
messaging. Most Free Software groups use those anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After two and a half days of workshop, all 15 participants ended
up rather tired. However we had plenty of fun and learned
a lot. Surprisingly, the group came up with a good amount of
real, usable ideas for activities. Be very afraid :-) The guidance
and mentoring by the experienced campaigners from Peng! Collective
helped tremendously. Of course the workshop was merely an exercise in
how to develop and run a campaign for software freedom. The bulk of
the work is now ahead of us. But we are off to a good start. We
are curious where this road will take us.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Birthday party at Endocode in Berlin: 30 years Free Software Foundation</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2015-09-09-30-years-of-fsf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2015-09-09-30-years-of-fsf/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 3 October 2015 Free Software Foundation Europe invites you for the

&lt;p>The Free Software Foundation was founded in 1985 and since then
promotes computer users’ rights to use, study, copy, modify, and
redistribute computer programs. It also helps to spread awareness of
the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The birthday party in Berlin, organised by FSFE, will take place from
&lt;em>15:00 to 18:00 on 3 October 2015&lt;/em> at Endocode AG, &lt;a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.51290&amp;amp;amp;mlon=13.41781#map=17/52.51290/13.41781" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brückenstraße 5A,

statt. In diesem Jahr mit dabei war das Seminar &lt;a href="http://www.evstudienwerk.de/aktuelles/veranstaltungen/sommeruniversitaet/65.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source in
Wirtschaft und
Gesellschaft&lt;/a>
von Mirko Boehm. Paul Adams unterstützte als Ko-Referent. Karsten
Gerloff, Präsident der &lt;a href="http://fsfe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FSFE&lt;/a>, trat als Gastredner
auf. Da sich die Teilnehmer ihre Seminare nach eigenem Interesse
selbst aussuchen, fand sich ein bunte Mischung von Medizinern über
Naturwissenschaftlern bis zu Theologen zusammen. Die Verbindung aus
Neugier, Heterogenität der Gruppe und inspirierender Umgebung sorgte
für explosive Debatten, hitzige Diskussionsrunden und eine wie Flug
vergangene Woche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Schwerpunkte des Seminars waren die Fragen, wie
Open-Source-Communities eigentlich funktionieren, was Einzelne zur
Mitwirkung motiviert, wie sich freie Produkte in die
Wirtschaftsordnung integrieren und welche politischen
Herausforderungen und Veränderungen zu bewältigen sind. Während
schnell Einverständnis herrschte darüber, das der &lt;em>Open Source Way&lt;/em>
ein gesellschaftliches und kein technisches Problem ist, wurde zu
anderen sonst in der
&lt;a href="http://saschalobo.com/2013/03/22/unsere-muetter-unsere-fehler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netzgemeinde&lt;/a>
als selbstverständlich vermutete Ansichten wie &amp;ldquo;das Internet gehört

Verantwortung für durch unvorsichtige Bewertungen beschädigte
Reputation, muss alle Teilhabe in Zukunft im Netz stattfinden, braucht
es eine Internetpolizei, das Strafrecht der realen Welt erweiternde
Sanktionen, die Regulierung des Netzes? Durch die diversen Blickwinkel
war manchmal nicht klar, wer mehr von wem lernte, die Seminarleitung
oder die Teilnehmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Karsten Gerloff berichtete über die politische Bedeutung von Freier
Software und offener Innovation, die Bedrohung durch Softwarepatente
und die Kampagnenarbeit der FSFE.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Die Beschäftigung mit der Materie war dabei von deutlicher
Ernsthaftigkeit geprägt. Zum Beispiel brauchten die Teilnehmer etwa
fünf Minuten, um den systematischen Unterschied bei der Integration
von Copyleft- oder Permissive-lizensierten Beiträgen zu verstehen -
ein Prozess, der bei nicht wenigen Freie-Software-Communities entweder
gar nicht oder erst recht spät verstanden wird. Paul Adams war
sichtlich beeindruckt. Dieses tiefe Eintauchen ins Thema steht
beispielhaft für das allgemein starke Engagement der Stipendiaten, die
ihr Studienwerk in weiten Bereichen selbst verwalten - bis hin zur
Zusammenstellung des Programms der Sommeruniversität selbst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bei der traditionell turbulenten Abschlussveranstaltung am
Donnerstagabend wurden die &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vier

verdeutlicht&amp;hellip; Unser einstimmiges Fazit - definitiv eine Woche
lohnend investierter Zeit, die Paul Adams und ich in guter Erinnerung
behalten werden. Neben den Teilnehmern war auch das Organisationsteam
(ebenfalls sich freiwillig engagierende Stipendiaten) ausgesprochen
engagiert und sorgte für einen reibungslosen, angenehmen Ablauf von
insgesamt sechs parallel verlaufenden Seminaren. Sehr beeindruckend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's the Free Software, stupid!</title><link>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-its-the-free-software-stupid/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jun 2012 18:08:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-its-the-free-software-stupid/</guid><description>&lt;p>Heated discussions are going on in the KDE community in the aftermath
of the announcement of Nokia&amp;rsquo;s platform strategy change. Rationality
often goes out of the window when people feel such a change goes
against their personal values or beliefs. In the past days, I worked
on an analysis of the impact of the changes on KDAB, Qt and the Free
Software communities we work with, especially KDE. KDAB is rooted
deeply in the KDE community, and many of our developers work with Qt
and KDE for years now. We are sharing the same worries and hopes, so
the results may be interesting for others as well. This post is about
Qt, KDE, Free Software, politics, devices, markets, strategies - it
does not get much better than that. Read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="be-thankful-for-what-you-got">Be thankful for what you got&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are told to judge by actions, not by words, so let us have a look
at the development of Qt since Nokia bought Trolltech, and how the KDE
community benefitted from it. It is important to stress this up front
because it is easy to forget that since then, Nokia has been a very
important benefactor. KDE is based on Qt and always relied heavily
it&amp;rsquo;s technical advances. Trolltech convinced many developers to use Qt
because of it&amp;rsquo;s superior quality and ease of use and the friendly and
inspiring developer community. But it was a small company, and could
not have afforded to forgo the license revenue made from selling
commercial Qt licenses. This revenue was the central pillar of
Trolltech&amp;rsquo;s business model. Trolltech was also in the uneasy situation
that it influenced the software industry way more than it&amp;rsquo;s small size
warranted, and attracted the attention of much larger
competitors. With the takeover, the revenue Trolltech generated was to
a large extend irrelevant to Nokia. The development framework is a
strategic asset, and selling Qt licenses is not in line with Nokia&amp;rsquo;s
core competencies. It also made perfect business sense to invest even
more resources that could never have been afforded from the license
revenue, to be able to rely on Qt as the future UI platform. This
investment resulted in huge performance improvements, new technologies
like QML, a continuous stable development process with many releases,
Qt Creator, and many other goodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the biggest gift Nokia ever presented us with was to relicense Qt
under the LGPL. It finally overcame the acceptance issue with Qt in
the wider Free Software space, and helped grow the Qt user base
massively. While other important safeguards like the Free Qt
Foundation were already in place, using Qt under the LGPL license is
so much less of a hurdle to take then to enforce the rights granted
through the Free Qt Foundation. Those rights can also only be executed
once, and only as an action of last resort. Without Qt under LGPL,
MeeGo would not have been accepted by the software industry. This, the
public hosting of the Qt git repo and the massive development manpower
Nokia invested in Qt benefit KDE immensely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best part is that none of these presents can be un-given or taken
away. Qt is there to stay under the current Free Software licenses,
and the quality it gained in the recent years will also remain at
KDE&amp;rsquo;s service. There are new developments in KDE like QML and QtQuick
that KDE still has to fully make use of. Today&amp;rsquo;s Qt is a superb
platform to base the development of KDE on in the coming
years. Thanks, Nokia.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="qt">Qt&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is an open question how these past achievements translate into the
future when it comes to Qt&amp;rsquo;s own development. From talking to business
partners and contacts at Nokia, it is pretty clear that no new
direction has been set for the Qt unit at Nokia. The announcement that
there will be no layoffs or budget cuts is comforting, but it needs to
be taken with a grain of salt. It may have all kinds of reasons, for
example personnel retention, local labor laws, maintaining an
undamaged business unit that can be sold - or the simple lack of an
updated strategy. So all these statements have to be mentally extended
with an &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;until further notice&amp;rdquo;. By definition, strategy changes do
not occur on a regular basis. Even if the Microsoft partnership is
unsuccessful (in sales figures, for example), it will take 3 to 5
years for that to be realized and the strategy to be re-evaluated. In
that time frame, there will most certainly be changes to the Qt unit
if it remains within Nokia.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="checking-the-facts-about-nokia-platforms-shipping-qt">Checking the facts about Nokia platforms shipping Qt&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Nokia plans to ship another 150 million Symbian devices with Qt
installed. The ability to do so depends heavily on the appeal of these
phones to users willing to pay more than the magical 100 Euro barrier
price. A vivid app market is necessary to reach this goal, since apps
are a major sales driver in today&amp;rsquo;s smartphones. Will companies keep
investing in the fledgling Symbian plus Qt app space? Investors shy
away from shrinking markets. Every corporate strategist tasked with
developing a product-market-matrix will put anything Symbian related
into the &amp;ldquo;de-invest&amp;rdquo; bracket. Why does the Symbian market shrink? Have
a look at the diagram that visualizes the spectrum of Nokia phones
(while creating the image I discovered how close the Qt and the
Windows Phone 7 shades of green are - a coincidence? I guess we will
never know).&lt;/p>

The Nokia Qt Dilemma
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The lower end S30/S40 devices are becoming more attractive because
features are added to them that so far required a smart
phone. Internet access becomes more and more pervasive, and apps are
being developed for these devices now. Having a Facebook app, for
example, will be a convincing argument for those buyers who never
really wanted a clunky smartphone. Also, these not-so-dumb phones will
continue to be developed and shipped under the new strategy, resulting
in better customer acceptance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through constantly improving hardware, the smartphones are being sold
at steadily decreasing prices. The cheapest Android phones are now at
below 100 Euro. This puts additional pressure on the sales revenue
generated by the current high-end Symbian phones. Customer acceptance
plays an important role in this segment as well. Read the latest
tweets, and half of them are in the line of &amp;ldquo;I finally got rid of my
Nokia and got an Android phone now&amp;rdquo;. Customers will shy away from a
line of phones that is already announced to be replaced. It is like
beating the proverbial dead horse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the Symbian market segment will shrink, and with that the
importance (and clout) of Qt within Nokia. Customers do not care about
mobile OSes to a large extend. As soon as an average S40 phone will
ship apps and have internet access, the middle bracket in the above
diagram will fade away. Nokia is trying to define a &amp;ldquo;mid range phone&amp;rdquo;
segment between the feature phones (S30/S40) and the smartphone (WP7)
ranges. This segment is not established in the phone market, and it is
questionable whether there will be a niche for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of that, app developers will hesitate to invest in the
platform, and the Qt mobile ecosystem will be under a lot of
pressure. In all the Nokia devices, Qt will not gain the widest
coverage of all development platforms. Very likely it will be S30/S40,
by device count, and WP7, by sales volume. Remember this is about Qt
within Nokia. It only influences KDE indirectly, by defining Qt&amp;rsquo;s role
in the platform strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="qt-on-other-mobile-platforms">Qt on other Mobile Platforms&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With apps currently being developed in Java for the S30/S40 based
phones, Nokia uses 3 different development platforms for it&amp;rsquo;s phone
lineup, Java, Symbian with Qt, and WP7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a hopelessly romantic rumor that Qt support might come for
the S30/S40 platform. A reality check is needed here. The low-end
devices are shipping with S30/S40 because it is available today, not
because it is a great modern future-proof platform. The apps for these
phones are being developed now, or within the next twelve months. Even
if a full-scale Qt port is started today, it won&amp;rsquo;t be available
short-term. No doubt the Qt community will be able to pull off that
stunt. But finishing the port is one thing, getting it through quality
acceptance and to the point where it is shipped in devices is
another. App developers would only target those devices when they
gained a sufficient market share, and by that time, an Android phone
sells for 50 Euro. Because of that, I do not think there will be an
official strategy to make Qt available on S30/S40. And since Qt is
also not coming to to WP7, Qt&amp;rsquo;s cross platform claim is moot within
Nokia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the Qt ports to Androids, Blackberries, Badas and Kindles become a
viable reality, other vendors will sell more devices supporting Qt
than Nokia. And that is a development going on now, while Nokia will
need between one and two years to release the first WP7 phone. These
forces will heavily impede Nokia&amp;rsquo;s ability to differentiate based on
the features of Qt, and result in less motivation to base a future
strategy on Qt as a disruptive technology. The disruption will happen
while Nokia is developing it&amp;rsquo;s first WP7 phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-governance-of-qt">Open Governance of Qt&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Regarding Open Governance, it is another open question if this strategy is
viable for Qt in the absence of a major investor (of time and money)
that drives the development. There is a good chance that it ends up
like XFree.org and produces little more than bike shedding for a long
time. Free Software projects under Open Governance, like the Linux
kernel, or X.org, or - not quite the same, but very similar - the C++
standard, tend to innovate slowly. Because of that, I am not convinced
that an impressive Qt 5 can be developed by the community under Open
Governance in a reasonable time frame. Do not get this wrong: The idea
is great, the problem is that it might not work out as we all hope
for. Three major scenarios come to mind when thinking about the future
of Qt&amp;rsquo;s governance:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Nokia considers Qt a strategic asset, and continues to heavily
invest in it. In this case, Open Governance has a chance to
succeed, but might not be in Nokia&amp;rsquo;s own interest, since it will be
losing control over it&amp;rsquo;s own important technology.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Qt is switched into maintenance mode, because it is not seen as
important for the future. In this case, Open Governance will have a
hard time to be implemented in the first place, and partners will
hesitate to take responsibility for individual modules.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nokia plans to sell the Qt unit as an asset. In this case, the
potential buyer will want enforceable control over it&amp;rsquo;s
investment. For that plan, Open Governance devalues Qt as a
sellable product. The biggest challenge for the transition to Open
Governance is to make sure the companies invested in Qt support it
fully, and want to see it happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Maybe I missed a scenario that will make it work? Please post your
feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest challenge for Qt itself will be the potential talent
drain. Qt attracted excellent developers from all over the world
because it was innovative and elite. Those are people that won&amp;rsquo;t be
comfortable with being parked on the back burner, and might not feel
at home with Nokia anymore. At the same time, they do not exactly have
problems finding another job. It will be hard for Nokia to convince
employees not to leave, and also to hire new talent of the same
quality. This is a long-term threat to the quality of Qt, and it&amp;rsquo;s
ability to innovate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="countering-the-threat-of-free-software-in-the-mobile-market">Countering the &amp;ldquo;threat&amp;rdquo; of Free Software in the mobile market&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Android based devices and Nokia smartphones together make up 64% of
the global smartphone market at the time of this writing, according to
Wikipedia (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone)&lt;/a>. If Nokia would
have successfully transitioned to a MeeGo based smartphone line with
Qt GUIs, the majority of the mobile devices market would use Free
Software based development tools, on open and inviting ecosystems for
developers, a competitive app market with low entry barriers, all in
all promising innovation and affordable devices. Nokia was looking for
a solution for it&amp;rsquo;s future platform problem, and it was determined to
base it on Free Software. The stock market loved the idea. Google
agreed, too, and made Android.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, market demand for Windows based phones is at an
overall low. There is simply no need for another closed proprietary
phone OS, considering the alternatives. The tendency of it becoming an
accepted standard that phone software platforms should be based on
Free Software threatens Microsofts investment in WP7, and it&amp;rsquo;s general
position as a closed operating system vendor. WP7 was a solution
looking for a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is probably a large overlap of institutional investors in Nokia
and Microsoft, given that they are both market leaders and publicly
traded companies. Both companies see their markets under siege, and
are not doing very well, so it might have sounded like a good idea at
the time to combine the hardware vendor looking for a phone OS with
the phone OS vendor looking for hardware. The partnership is
unbalanced though, because if it fails, Microsoft will still be the
market leader in PC OS installations, and Nokia will have lost
relevance in the global smart phone market. The stock market did not
love that idea so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it is seriously hard to believe that simply pushing WP7 to the
market was Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s only motivation. Also, there are other vendors
that started offering WP7 phones. So why Nokia? There must be another
compelling reason for Microsoft to first send a top-ranking emissary
to Nokia, and then form a partnership that by all the usual criteria
looks like a takeover. This reason that was important enough for
Microsoft to invest billions into Nokia was to battle Free Software in
it&amp;rsquo;s emerging mobile market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The strategic goal of ensuring that future phone OSes are based on
proprietary and in particular not on Free Software was very likely the
major motivator for Microsoft to pursue this unequal partnership. The
recent ban of Free Software from the Microsoft app store indicates a
similar motivation. Nokia&amp;rsquo;s Free Software based platform strategy is
dead, and it will not come back. This means Microsoft achieved one
strategic goal immediately by establishing the partnership and
aborting Nokia&amp;rsquo;s Free Software based efforts. If this move was about
WP7 introduction into the market, why rely on the stumbling giant
Nokia, and not on one of the hungry Asian tigers, like HTC, who are
already offering WP7 phones? Because those did not have a Free
Software based strategy. Maemo or MeeGo together with Android are a
thought unbearable to Microsoft.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>About Qt - Qt was a compelling toolkit that developers loved to work
with before Nokia bought it. That is the real reason for it&amp;rsquo;s
success. Developers tell their managers that they want to use Qt
rather than something else. That quality of Qt has gotten even
better. This is why I think Qt will continue to be strong and - after
the shakeout happening now - to grow in both the Free Software and the
commercial development spaces. Qt reputation with decision makers has
been damaged, though. They regarded it not only as stable from a
software point of view, but also as being trustworthy from a
development process and maintenance point of view. This image has been
severely tarnished. So for now, the Qt market will shrink because
mobile users will leave, and it will recover and grow at a slower rate
afterwards due to the reduced willingness of developers and decision
makers to invest in it. The change of pace might be a good thing for
Qt itself after the recent coding marathons it went through. The
trolls will work hard on keeping Qt the best and one and only true
cross-platform UI toolkit on the planet. I wish them all the best for
the turbulent time to come. Hug a troll, everybody!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About KDE - KDE as a technology will not be affected much right
now. Qt is Free Software and does not change over night. There are
enough great new features that KDE still has to digest. Even the
longer term outlook of the strategy for Qt only has an indirect effect
on KDE. Not many developers joined KDE because of the prospect of Qt
on mobile phones, so even the community will remain stable. The
development focus of Qt becomes broader again, away from concentrating
on features for the mobile space. Whether Nokia will continue to
support KDE at the same scale as in the last years is mostly a PR
decision, so it is also not related to the more technical aspects
described above. It will depend on the friendly relationship that has
been developed so far, and how it continues. Nonetheless, the next KDE
version will be shipped on time. KDE is in good shape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About Free Software - Nokia&amp;rsquo;s strategy change is a very sad
development in this regard, because it is not just about Qt. Microsoft
is trying to prevent Free Software from becoming mainstream in the
mobile space. Beside the feeling that it is already too late for that,
the process raises the question if such activity against the GNU
competition should be concerning the regulators. Antitrust and other
market law protects businesses from unfair competition, but
unfortunately it does not protect Free Software communities or
projects from being bullied. Indirectly preventing a competitor from
entering the market, for example, can be a reason for the antitrust
agencies to not approve such a partnership, but only if large
businesses are involved that are able to prevent the usual market
forces from working. This is a political issue, and needs to be
brought forward to policy makers. Our interests, those of Free
Software as a force to create better working and more competitive
markets, are not sufficiently represented there. That is why I will
join the FSFE.&lt;/p>
