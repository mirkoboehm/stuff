a marvelous stunt -
the
&lt;a href="https://openoil.net/portfolio/oil-contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Oil Contracts Booksprint&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnny-west-2509098" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnny West&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://zararah.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zara Rahman&lt;/a> and their supporters gathered oil
contract experts from across the globe
at &lt;a href="http://www.schloss-neuhausen.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schloss Neuhausen&lt;/a> to achieve
something that has never done before - create a book that explains how
to understand an oil contract. Not only did such a book not exist,
they also published it under a Creative Commons license. And because
that is not enough of a challenge, they did it all in one week.&lt;/p>

Oil Contracts - How to read and understand them
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Oil contracts determine the share of the oil revenue that the country
who owns the oil, the international oil companies and others
receive. From the book: &amp;ldquo;It is petroleum contracts that express how
[the] money is split and who makes what profits, just as it is the
contracts that determine who manages operations and how issues such as
the environment, local economic development, and community rights are
dealt with. The share price of ExxonMobil, the question of who carries
responsibility for Deepwater Horizon, whether Uganda will be able to
stop importing petrol, and how much it costs to heat and light homes
in millions of homes ­­ these are issues which depend directly on
clauses in the contracts signed between the governments of the world
and the oil companies. For most of the 150 years of oil production,
these contracts have remained hidden, nested in a broader secrecy that
surrounded all aspects of the industry. Governments claimed national
security prerogatives, companies said commercial sensitivity precluded
making them available.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>People who have attended an Open Source develoment sprint may notice
that the desk in the picture pretty much looks like at one of them. A
book sprint applies techniques and tools developed in the Open Source
world to authoring. Gather the relevant people, get them to a remote
location with little distraction, and then allow them to focus on
producing something they are passionate about. As in software, the
results are impressive. Collaborative editing tools are used to
coordinate between authors, editors and illustrators, similar to
version control. It is also noteworthy that of the different expert
that attended the sprint, all attended on a pro-bono basis or as part
of their day job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://openoil.net/portfolio/oil-contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;How to understand an oil contract&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> book
is a good read even for people who are only casually interested in the
politics of oil. How the book was produced serves as a great example
of the Open Source way adopted by other, less technology related
sectors. And if the book contributes to making oil contracts better
understood and more comparable, the world has just become a better
place.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
