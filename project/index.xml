how to use or build software. Such documentation often contains shell
commands demonstrating how to build or run it. To ensure documentation
remains accurate and up-to-date, it should be automatically
tested. shelldoc tests Unix shell commands in Markdown files and
reports the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>shelldoc parses Markdown files, identifies code blocks containing shell
commands, executes them, and verifies that the output matches the
documented expectations. It produces JUnit XML output for CI
integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I relaunched shelldoc in 2026 after a maintenance hiatus. Version 0.90
is the first of three release candidates on the road to 1.0, featuring
bug fixes, security improvements, modernization to Go 1.21, and GitHub
Actions CI with visual test reports.&lt;/p>

It was commissioned by the European Commission’s DG CONNECT. It is estimated that companies located in the EU invested around €1 billion in OSS in 2018, which resulted in an impact on the European economy of between €65 and €95 billion. The analysis estimates a cost-benefit ratio of above 1:4 and predicts that an increase of 10% of OSS contributions would annually generate an additional 0.4% to 0.6% GDP as well as more than 600 additional ICT start-ups in the EU. Case studies reveal that by procuring OSS instead of proprietary software, the public sector could reduce the total cost of ownership, avoid vendor lock-in and thus increase its digital autonomy. The study also contains an analysis of existing public policy actions in Europe and around the world. The scale of Europe’s institutional capacity related to OSS, however, is disproportionately smaller than the scale of the value created by OSS. The study therefore gives a number of specific public policy recommendations aimed at achieving a digitally autonomous public sector, open R&amp;amp;D enabling European growth and a digitised and internally competitive industry.&lt;/p>

barriers for interaction between standardisation and open source
processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The study should clarify the role of open source in the context of
standard setting, in particular its interplay with the licensing of
standards-essential patents under &amp;ldquo;fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory&amp;rdquo; (FRAND) terms and provide an overview of free and
open source software (FOSS) and FRAND features in standardisation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The study on the interaction between open source software and FRAND
licensing in standardisation is carried out on behalf of the &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/joint-research-centre_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European
Commission&amp;rsquo;s Joint Research
Centre&lt;/a>
by &lt;a href="https://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fraunhofer Institute of Open Communication System
