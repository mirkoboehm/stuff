on communicating complex political
goals. The
<a href="http://www.fluchthelfer.in/?lang=en" target=_blank rel=noopener>escape helpers campaign</a> leaves
the audience conflicted between the two choices of being a good human
rights activists (driven by ideals and demonstrating solidarity with
refugees) and being a good citizen (by abiding to the law). Great,
because the message is to re-think what is legal against what is
right. The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At9rWPj7MzU" target=_blank rel=noopener>#slamshell performance</a>
emotionally demonstrated the risks associated with oil drilling that
are normally regarded as marginal.</p><p>These campaigns translate abstract, distant risks or worries into
concrete, tangible calls to action. By being provocative, they break
the mold and reach a wide audience online and through
traditional media. They are &ldquo;cat content for social change&rdquo;, as our
tutors put it. Campaigners are being urged to stop preaching or
complaining and to start using positive communication combined with
subversive PR work instead. Such messaging needs punchlines, which
requires some kind of hyperbole - dadaism, hijacking attention, or
provocation.</p><p>Campaign development is still a pretty down to earth task. Through
fact finding research and the analysis of campaign goals, supporting
allies and potential opponents, answers to the four essential
questions are being narrowed down: What is the change that we want to
achieve? How can this change be brought about? Who can make that
change we want to see? And who has power over the involved people or
groups? Setting campaign goals is often a compromise between achieving
big changes locally or small changes &ldquo;globally&rdquo;. It helps to envision
the impact of the campaign through utopia/dystopia brainstorms: What
would a world look like where all campaign goals have been achieved
perfectly? What would it look like if everything went horribly wrong?
These kind of mental exercises also help to explain the relevance of
the campaign goals and show how the intended change can affect
people&rsquo;s lives. The goals may be perfectly obvious to those passionate
about them already, but not to outsiders - a common problem regarding
the ethics and ideals of Free Software.</p><p>Implementing a campaign involves many standard, by the book project
management tasks. The individual publicity stunts and activities are
the actions that form the campaign timeline. A dilemma specific to the
FSFE is that the relevant and influential media - social networks
especially - are the kind of centralized proprietary platforms against
which we are advocating. However, we learned that it may be possible
to play this situation to our advantage :-) Since the FSFE&rsquo;s goals
require some heavy lifting of Free Software lobbying, the campaign
timeline extends far into the future. We found ourselves thinking
about what to present at conferences a year or more into the
future. Finalizing the campaign plan involves answering the
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; question of what time, material and talent is required to
perform the tasks, and to put them into a timeline. Often this
includes outside help for extra manpower or professional
expertise. Noticeably, those with technical backgrounds tend to haste
towards a release, underestimating the lead time required to get
there, and the duration of the campaign. This tendency works almost,
but not quite, entirely unlike in software projects. Securing and
confirming the support of allies and protagonists also takes time.</p><p>The planned actions need to be reviewed with a focus group that
resembles or at least understands the target audience. This review
should confirm that the message conveyed is in fact understandable and
makes sense. It is not possible to get a clear answer on whether or
not a campaign project needs an ultimate decision maker. The answer
depends too much on the composition of the campaign team and the
timeline of the project. The necessary communication infrastructure is
pretty straightforward - tasks boards, and instead and asynchronous
messaging. Most Free Software groups use those anyway.</p><p>After two and a half days of workshop, all 15 participants ended
up rather tired. However we had plenty of fun and learned
a lot. Surprisingly, the group came up with a good amount of
real, usable ideas for activities. Be very afraid :-) The guidance
and mentoring by the experienced campaigners from Peng! Collective
helped tremendously. Of course the workshop was merely an exercise in
how to develop and run a campaign for software freedom. The bulk of
the work is now ahead of us. But we are off to a good start. We
are curious where this road will take us.</p></div><div class=article-tags><a class="badge badge-light" href=/tag/foss/>FOSS</a>
