those was on &ldquo;Addressing lock-in challenges through the use of open

Lundell</a>,
a fellow of the academy and professor at the University of Skövde in

read and write data formats of digital assets of long-term
importance.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><figure id=figure-standard-and-file-format-lock-in><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=w-100><img alt="Standard and File Format Lock-In" srcset="/media/img/post/2019-09-10_Lundell_OFA-workshop_Brussels_Slide4_hu8d291b392dc10072f966ead193d17207_756001_dcd68d2df68f540c1b1f3a30e5b163b6.webp 400w,

discussion of potential core topics for the OpenForum Academy to focus.
OpenForum Europe champions openness in Europe, a topic that has
sprawled into numerous debates. Which ones of those are important and
warrant the development of academic papers and policy briefs?</p><figure><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=w-100><img alt="OpenForum Academy workshop attendees" srcset="/media/img/post/2019-09-OFA-workshop_hu8e638188a6937bd07708cddf65e33c5a_503509_6222910029fc230ca872a420ba777c1c.webp 400w,

However,
there are other dimensions of openness that cover different processes
and results. There is still a discussion of what an <em>open standard</em>
is. <em>Open hardware</em> works quite differently to software, because the
open specifications eventually have to be turned into physical
goods. Access to data is an angle independent from software,
specifications and hardware, and most software is made useful by the data
sets it processes. We want more scientific articles to be
available under <em>open access</em> licenses, especially when they are
creating with public funding. The list of topics related to openness
is probably never-ending. Eventually, the following aspects emerged
as the currently most interesting ones:</p><h3 id=openness-and-the-cloud>Openness and the Cloud</h3><p>How the transition of ICT to cloud and edge services changes the
importance of FOSS and data unsurprisingly sparked a heated debate
during the workshop. Is software freedom threatened by the rise of
cloud computing because software modifications are not required to be
shared? How can vendor lock-in and a lack of choice be overcome? Very
importantly, what is new about cloud that is different to before
(hint: it may be less than we think)? How can consumer interests be
protected and a healthy business ecosystem promoted? How can
regulation help and where does regulation overreach (think
surveillance or user profiling)? Many of these questions are about
finding the right balance, or identifying the justified intrusions
into the user&rsquo;s rights to confidentiality and privacy.</p><h3 id=open-source-as-civil-ict-infrastructure>Open Source as Civil ICT Infrastructure</h3><p>The EU invests in railroads, highways and data networks. Why does it
not invest much into
FOSS? <a href=https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/EUFOSSA2-Survey target=_blank rel=noopener>FOSSA</a>
(hint: please participate in the survey!) is a good start. Much more
could be done. Civil society is stepping in to take over public
functions, as in the preservation of knowledge fostered by Wikipedia
or Software Heritage, often with little public support. What would be
a framework under which the EU and member states can invest into FOSS
development, to serve it&rsquo;s own needs or to support support
sustainability goals? Can a public investment plan be developed for
the development of OSS ICT infrastructure, including goals and spends?</p><h3 id=commercial-business-models-and-open-source>Commercial Business Models and Open Source</h3><p>Much has been discussed recently about the sustainability of FOSS
development, often confusing it the viability of the own business
model. Norms that form the pillars of the FOSS movement like
the
<a href=https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html target=_blank rel=noopener>four freedoms of software</a> or
the <a href=https://opensource.org/osd target=_blank rel=noopener>Open Source Definition</a> embody
community culture at the expense of legalistic terminology. Recently,
models have emerged that remove some of the freedoms guaranteed by
those norms, for example in the deceptively
named <a href=https://commonsclause.com target=_blank rel=noopener>Commons Clause License</a>. The
relation between FOSS and other rights like trademarks or patents is
still a much researched topic. Directly related to that are approaches
on how to valuate FOSS and FOSS based businesses to give guidance to
industry, VCs and policy makers for investment decisions. Some of our
fellows feel it is important to take a stand as a community, insist on
making it clear what FOSS really is and prevent a watering down of
standards like the Open Source Definition. There is a need to explain
the work of the wider FOSS community more clearly to illustrate how it
interacts with and contributes to society.</p><h2 id=how-to-contribute-and-get-involved>How to contribute and get involved</h2><p>The academy believes that these topic are of wide-ranging importance
to the development of the digital society and the single market in the
EU. They warrant a thorough investigation, deep analysis and a search
for solutions that connects research, industry and policy makers. We
hope to support this process by selecting these three subjects as
focus topics for the OpenForum Academy for the upcoming year. The
academy will facilitate the work of it&rsquo;s fellows through workshops,
publications and other means. If you are a researcher, practitioner,
