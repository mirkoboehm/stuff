question -
<a href=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Can-open-source-be-democratic-1663702.html target=_blank rel=noopener>&ldquo;Can Open Source be democratic?&rdquo;</a> He
describes how Free Software emerged as a distributed, bottom-up system
of writing code. The central defining aspects of that culture are a
uniquely open process not just of programming but also of its
organization, and a close relationship between programmers and
users. Effectively, users and programmers together were both
contributors, they collaborated on the project. Glyn goes on to
explain how this community effort changed over time to become more
institutionalized, more corporate and more dull - &ldquo;becoming a &lsquo;Firefox
Affiliate&rsquo;, hardly something that sets the pulse racing.&rdquo; Ordinary
users no longer play an important part in Open Source projects.</p><figure id=figure-for-aristotle-the-underlying-principle-of-democracy-is-freedom-since-only-in-a-democracy-the-citizens-can-have-a-share-in-freedom><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><div class=w-100><img alt=Aristotle srcset="/media/img/post/aristotle-altemps_hue90612a493a95dbd18bbb2231dca5ed8_2244558_b6ea70e7a2f1482223e96218d8fd5a3c.webp 400w,

assumption needs to be questioned. Open Source communities have been
coined to be self-directed, meritocratic,  &mldr;, but it is rarely
emphasized that they are democratic. Since individuals are investing
effort in their favorite projects to contribute to something greater,
and democracy is commonly considered to be a greater good as well, it
is intriguing to make the jump to thinking of Open Source communities
as being democratic. But are they? What is the meaning of democracy in
the context of Open Source? What does a democratic community look
like?</p><p>Some may say that such political concepts cannot easily be transferred
to how Open Source communities should function. While it may not be
easy, it is still worthwhile - democracies have dealt with similar
problems of inclusion and the distribution of power and
responsibility. Just like democratic states, communities are volunteer
organizations that congregate to build the public goods they desire in
the commons. Just like citizens, members of communities have a choice
of voice or exit that they make based on the expected influence they
have as citizens. There are enough similarities to justify learning by
example.</p><h2 id=on-being-a-contributor>On being a contributor</h2><p>Democracy means &ldquo;rule of the people&rdquo;, and postulates, amongst other
things, for each individual to be equal before the law and to have a
vote in the political process and election of the government. This
immediately boils down to the central Yin-Yang question of who is a
citizen and who is not. Are users considered integral parts (citizens)
of the Open Source communities, or outsiders who provide feedback? And
should they be the equals of developers?  While today we seem to think
that equality comes standard, it is in fact a dynamic concept, its
meaning changes with culture. Think about the Voting Rights Act of
1965 that finally abolished voter&rsquo;s discrimination by race in the US,
or the fact that women will gain the right to vote in Saudi Arabia in
the year 2015. This is what Glyn observes - users changed from being
integral elements of the community to playing an only marginal role,
akin to not having a vote.</p><p>Eligibility and acceptance are what discerns citizens from barbarians
and slaves. Eligibility answers the question of which individuals can
potentially become citizens. Acceptance is the requirements an
eligible individual has to fulfill to gain citizenship. For example, a
foreigner living in a country may be eligible for citizenship, but to
be accepted needs to pay taxes for a number of years. When the same
questions are applied to Open Source communities, they translate to
&ldquo;Who is a contributor and could thus become a citizen of our
community? How does somebody join the project?&rdquo; and second, &ldquo;What
does a newcomer have to do to be considered a contributor, a part of
the community?&rdquo; (does that sound like &ldquo;How do I become a committer&rdquo;? -
exactly). In Open Source communities usually all individuals are
eligible to join, but to be accepted and integrated, they need to
<em>contribute to the code</em>.</p><p>So for users to become integral parts of Open Source communities
again, users that engage with an Open Source project need to be equal
contributors amongst peers, to be eligible. This is far from standard,
and not the mind-set of most contributors I know. Most communities I
work with value direct contributions to the project source code higher
than feedback from users. They (unconsciously?) consider users
outsiders and refer them to talk to the issue tracker, a proven way to
make sure they never come back again with more feedback. So firstly,
users need to be considered eligible to become community members, and
second their efforts (feedback, for example) need to qualify them for
acceptance as ordinary contributors.</p><h2 id=on-open-governance>On Open Governance</h2><p>But not all communities are created equal. When evaluating how
democratic a community is, we need to look at their reason to
exist. Not all Open Source projects are created by developers and
users together, and the distribution of power and responsibility
usually follows this outset goal or doctrine. If a project that is
founded by developers and users  grows organically into an openly
governed community (like KDE), it is likened to a democracy. A project
that is founded by a company (think Mozilla or Qt) and maybe allows
external contributors in along as they accept the decrees^wCLA of the
king^wowner company aches more towards an aristocracy. Not all
contributors are equals, and the ruling government cannot be replaced.</p><p>There has been a long debate over what the most central trait of a
democracy is. Opinions differ, but there is one question - can the
citizens, on a regular basis, re-elect or replace the ruling
government in a structured process, without the need for a revolution?
With this argument in mind, it becomes apparent that not all Open
Source communities are democratic. KDE is to an extend, with a weak
government and regular elections where every active member has exactly
one vote. Think about electing a new government for Android, and the
difference becomes apparent. Of the Open Source projects Glyn
mentioned in his post, few can be considered democratic by this
standard.</p><p>Back to the question on how to reduce the distance between users and
developers and how to build communities that thrive on
collaboration. Users, like any contributor, will consider the effect
their investment of time into the project will have. If the utility
they gain from contributing outweighs the cost of the effort to
contribute, they will join the community and help with the
project. The utility is directly related to the openness of the
community governance; it will be less if the contributor&rsquo;s influence
is only on mundane details, and greater if she has the chance to
become the next president of KDE e.V. This emphasizes the importance
of Open Governance for the longevity and community spirit of Open
Source projects. Only with both the Open Source way and Open
Governance, the user experiences the freedom to create that convinces
her to join the project. Democracy in communities is Open Source
combined with Open Governance.</p><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2><p>From the status of being a contributor - a citizen - follows
the
<a href=https://endocode.com/blog/2012/03/16/managing-trust-in-mixed-commercial-and-volunteer-open-source-communities/ target=_blank rel=noopener>right and duty</a> to
take part in the community&rsquo;s affairs. Open Source can be democratic if
it treats all the community members equally. Three requirements for
considering an Open Source community democratic have been developed in
the discussion above:</p><ul><li>To be democratic requires not to discriminate amongst contributors
(users and developers). Users are contributors. They need to be
encouraged to join the community, to give feedback and to otherwise
help improve the project.</li><li>Demmocracy in communities means Open Source combined with Open
Governance. The availability of the source code under a Free
Software license is not sufficient for an Open Source community to
be democratic. Without equality, without the contributors
controlling the project as equals, it may be Open Source, but it is
not democratic.</li><li>Governance is open if the contributors are equals and the community
elects its own representation. Defining Open Governance as the
situation where the contributors are in control of their project on
all levels, democracy in an Open Source project can only be achieved
when all contributors have equal say on all matters of the project.</li></ul><p>Whether or not contributors fully are equals amongst peers can only be
decided by actions, not by words. The ethical question whether or not
democracy is desirable for an Open Source project has been avoided in
this article. In my personal opinion, Glyn is absolutely right: For
Open Source to continue being successful, direct and indirect
contributors need to get back to working together. With the widening
appeal of Open Source software, naturally developers will become more
experienced and professional, and the average user will turn to be
less technical and computer savvy. This trend will likely continue
with the growing user base of Open Source. And because it is
inevitable, Open Source projects should instead prepare to liaise more
with users and generally get good at integrating users and coders in
the community.</p><p style=text-align:center;font-size:80%><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US rel=license><img style=border-width:0 src=http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/80x15.png alt="Creative
