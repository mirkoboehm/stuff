This annual gathering brings together code-hosting open source foundations and partners to align on critical issues facing the ecosystem. After the Linux Foundation created Open Source Congress in 2023, each year a different organization has signed up as the host. I would like to thank the Eclipse Foundation for agreeing to be the host this year. The event focused on four key topics: open source in a multi-polar world, cybersecurity, sustainability, and regulation and public policy. The primary value of such gatherings lies in alignment and exchange rather than concrete actions. Since Open Source Congress operates under Chatham House rules and is less accessible than typical open source events, sharing insights from the discussions serves the wider community. Below are personal observations from the four panels.\nPanel 1 - Open Source in a Multi-Polar World The open source ecosystem was multi-polar from its inception. Key open source innovations originate from various regions: Ruby from Japan, Linux and Python from Europe, the GNU Project from the US. The US tech industry was quicker to realize open source technologies as a growth driver, allowing US business interests to overlay this narrative today. However, nothing is inherently polarizing in how the open source ecosystem works. It serves as both creative destruction and resilience mechanism, undermining traditional control structures while remaining largely unregulable. Cultural and language barriers continue to shape how and where contributors collaborate, making truly global collaboration a key challenge. There is optimism that AI will provide instant translation mechanisms to bridge such divides. Maintaining arms-length distance from policy making remains essential to preserve open source’s organic governance. At the same time, regulation will inevitably affect the ecosystem’s global dynamics. The EU Cyber Resilience Act is the first law explicitly shaping stakeholder roles. While progress has been made in building capacity and expertise for open source foundations to engage in policy debates when necessary, much work remains.\nPanel 2 - Cybersecurity: Influencing Best Practices and Standards A global race to define cybersecurity standards creates a maze of regulation across international markets. While this challenges global manufacturers, open source communities face few concrete regulatory obligations. However, to enable global adoption of their releases, they are strongly incentivized to support downstream users with documentation and sound cybersecurity practices. Creating an environment conducive to smooth upstream-downstream collaboration requires open source foundations to engage in relevant standards development processes that define implementation details of cybersecurity regulation. This remains difficult, as most stewards lack both funding and subject matter expertise for standards development. The panel revealed tensions between traditional open source collaboration and emerging bureaucratic frameworks at organizations like the UN and DPGA, warning that OSS risks losing its core strengths when bent to external rules. The discussion emphasized that effective policy engagement should facilitate organic collaboration and create market-driven incentives rather than impose rigid bureaucratic structures. Initiatives like the Linux Foundation’s Alpha-Omega serve as effective funding instruments that align with open source principles. In recent years, public initiatives like the German Sovereign Tech Agency increasingly support under-maintained projects. Under guidance from Open Forum Europe, a feasibility study has been submitted to the EU to elevate such activities to the European level with a larger budget.\nPanel 3 - Sustainability and the Open Ecosystem The sustainability of the open source development model is hotly debated. The underlying issue appears to be a mix of insufficient funding and a fundamental “matchmaking problem” of allocating available funds to specific projects and contributors efficiently. While the myth that open source is the unpaid labor of love of hobbyist maintainers still percolates, the 2024 Open Source Software Funding Survey shows that 86% of contribution value comes from employee labor. This study raises challenging questions. On one hand, what will be the effect of 50m€ public funding initiatives if $7.7B is invested by private industry annually? On the other hand, if more funding becomes available, how will it be distributed? Grant making will profoundly impact the viability of individual projects, raising concerns about public sector actors’ ability to effectively disperse sovereign-tech-fund-like funds where they are needed most, rather than to favored champions or consultancies specializing in grant acquisition. However, such initiatives will likely support ecosystem diversity and grassroots initiatives, which may be a benefit worth …","date":1758186e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1768398045,"objectID":"5d9dac19bbf2b79c03d3b250d8d90694","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2025-09-16-open-source-congress/","publishdate":"2025-09-18T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2025-09-16-open-source-congress/","section":"post","summary":"The third Open Source Congress took place in Brussels on 16 September 2025.

While the regulation will not fully apply until December 2027, with certain provisions taking effect earlier, the stakes are enormous—penalties reaching €15 million or 2.5% of global annual turnover for non-compliance.\nThe regulation’s impact extends beyond documentation and vulnerability reporting. It fundamentally alters the relationship between upstream open source projects and downstream commercial adopters, demanding greater collaboration for sustainable security maintenance. Neither manufacturers nor stewards can meet CRA requirements in isolation—manufacturers must conduct due diligence when integrating open source components, while stewards must implement and document cybersecurity policies that facilitate secure development. The Linux Foundation’s analysis of three flagship projects—Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP), Yocto Project, and Zephyr Project—reveals both the readiness and challenges facing open source software stewards under the new regulatory framework. The CRA introduces a novel distinction between commercial manufacturers who bear primary responsibility for product compliance, and open source software stewards who develop and maintain open source software without monetization. This acknowledges the reality that open source components often constitute up to 96% of modern software while respecting the fundamental openness of the development model.\n","date":1741996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1760694066,"objectID":"931e14780eb9b6fb28f224fd30706e93","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/publication/pathways-to-cybersecurity/","publishdate":"2025-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pathways-to-cybersecurity/","section":"publication","summary":"This case study report from the Linux Foundation investigates the impacts of the Cyber Resilience Act on open source software, including new cybersecurity obligations and the role of manufacturers and stewards.

Since then, open source has become mainstream and widely adopted, while remaining a driver of innovation. It has become the default way of developing software for many use cases, including the cloud and the web.  However, academic insight in the new field of how open source fosters innovation was still rare. Many aspects of open source were expressed in community culture, but not yet in published research.\nTo bridge this gap requires a combination of the two perspectives applied in this research, an inside view of open source communities and that of a researcher of innovation economics.  Beyond the effects that open source has on software technology and development methodology, its impact on innovation is especially visible in three key areas, namely the governance of collaboration in social groups, standards development and intellectual property regimes.  These three areas have been individually researched in scientific articles and in EU funded research projects, with the published results presented here as the main chapters.  Additionally, these separate perspectives are synthesized into a theoretical framework for the economics of open source, creating connections with concepts that are unique to it, like joint stewardship or the relationship between distributing software freely and expectations of fairness and reciprocity.\nThese results build on two larger studies, one on \"The relationship between open source software and standard setting\" and one on \"The impact of open source software and hardware on technological independence, competitiveness and innovation in the EU economy\" that were conducted in parallel, built on the concepts presented here and fed new insights back into this research.\nThe ICT sector is becoming increasingly regulated. Especially the EU is establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital products, services and markets. Since all ICT regulation will affect and interact with the open source ecosystem, understanding the dynamics between businesses and open source communities as they are shaped by intellectual property rights, standards and governance frameworks gains further increased relevance to the functioning of the market and to achieving regulatory goals.\nIn a time of deteriorating international security and increasing trade tensions, the global nature of open source collaboration limits the ability of regulators to control the flow of technologies, but also offers a way to collaborate across regional and political divides based on the principles of open governance and openly licensed outcomes.\nThis research aims to illustrate why and how open source drives innovation. With that, it hopes to suggest a theoretical foundation for how open source collaboration can be help to bridge regional and cultural divides and foster diversity, equity and inclusion.\n","tags":["FOSS","innovation","IPR","governance","standards"],"title":"The place of the open source ecosystem in the innovation landscape","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mirko Boehm"],"categories":null,"content":"The EU Cyber Resilience Act sets standards for how software should be designed, developed and distributed with security in mind.

Three years ago, I accepted an offer from MBition, the Mercedes-Benz infotainment development subsidiary, to develop their open source strategy and drive horizontal collaboration on the infotainment functionality in the automotive industry. Since then I have been on an amazing development journey culminating in the introduction of the new Mercedes-Benz E class, the first model to feature MBition’s next generation infotainment software. While delivering such an amazing product to market was exhilarating, I have always found a different joy from working directly in the open source community. As of today I am excited to announce I am going to be focusing on community development at Linux Foundation Europe.\nEurope has a special place in the open source community. It is home to projects like LibreOffice, KDE, as well as to CERN where the web was invented. Linux started in Scandinavia. But just as importantly, and besides ecosystem-defining projects like that, there is a culture of collaboration and community. Software Heritage is a great example of looking beyond “scratching your own itch” at how software shapes society. This sense of finding common ground and building community around it is at the heart of the European project for the last decades. At Linux Foundation Europe, I want to contribute to the open source software component of this larger effort.\nConcretely, I expect there will be three main stakeholders: industry, the volunteer open source community and the public sector. All three share a common interest in innovative, stable, secure open source projects, especially when they get adopted as software infrastructure components. However, the three groups also speak different languages and historically have trouble collaborating. This can be overcome, for example, by hosting projects like OpenWallet that bring regulators and industry together, but also tackle essential software freedom and digital sovereignty concerns. Open Source is most successful when it boils down to “show me the code” and facilitating contributions from all interested parties. Identifying prospects for such projects and building the collaboration between all stakeholders will be the essence of my work.\nRecently, there is a lot of attention on regulatory initiatives that affect the open source community, like the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) or the upcoming EU AI act. Working with the European Commision regulators to ensure that those initiatives support the open source projects that are the key innovation drivers in those areas instead of hindering them is an absolute top priority. However, the bigger picture of facilitating and growing projects that span industry, volunteer community and European governments should take centre stage in the longer term.

FRAND commitments aim to prevent intellectual property rights (‘IPR’) holders from refusing to license patents and from charging licensees excessive fees (unfair or unreasonable) for standard implemented patented technologies. The complex interface of open source software and standardisation processes is analysed with a specific focus on the role of IPR including FRAND licensing.

It enables competition by facilitating interoperability between products of different vendors. The wider open source community develops free and open source software (FOSS) in a global upstream/downstream model that similarly benefits society as a public good. FOSS and standards setting organizations (SSOs) are both instruments causing standardizing effects. Innovators and policy-makers assume that a mutually beneficial collaboration between them is desirable. However, their exact relationship is not fully understood, especially when and how FOSS and SSOs complement each other, or displace each other as competitors. To be able to compare FOSS and SSOs, our study develops a phase model of standardization that is applicable to both approaches, and applies this model to compare the strengths and weaknesses of FOSS and SSOs against common opportunities and threats in the ICT sector. Based on qualitative expert interviews with FOSS and SSO representatives, the synthesis of the separate results support conclusions from a product, a process and a societal perspective. The study identifies cost of change as a key determinant for the efficacy of each approach. It concludes that FOSS and SSOs create complementary products, compete for efficiency of the standardization process, and are both independent and complementary standardization instruments available to industry and influenceable by policy-makers. The paper closes with a discussion of possible implications relevant to businesses, the wider open source community, SSOs and policy-makers.","tags":["FOSS","academia","governance","standards"],"title":"Standard setting organizations and open source communities: Partners or competitors?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mirko Boehm"],"categories":null,"content":"We are video conferencing day-in day-out now. Small conversations via video call are a regular part of remote work. In times of restricted travel and polluted air, this is excellent. It also works pretty well for two or three people. With 6, it gets difficult to manage who speaks. Above ten, things get tricky both from a technical as well as a social perspective. We have all been in this call where there was an echo that blew everybody’s ears off, except for that one person that did not hear it (it was them). I have collected a few technical tips and practises over time that may help make video conferences easier and more enjoyable.\nIn situations with a small number of participants, there will be few technical issues. The technology for video conferencing handles such setups quite well. Group size is also a social matter – it is easy to ask your buddy in the one-to-one to hang on a second while you silence the phone. In a call with 20 people, it is rude to have the phone ring in the first place. So let’s be spoiled brats here and look at the finer things in demanding situations:\nBasics There are two main contributors to enjoyable video conferencing, network and media, as in audio and video. Both start to act up with more participants because network use increases with the number of participants and audio adds up as well from multiple sources. Let’s break it down.\nNetworking Choppy audio or hanging video often indicate issues with networking (or too much load on the computer, but that is less common today). Network issues can be related to bandwidth, latency and stability.\nRegarding bandwidth, a good audio stream requires a couple of KB per second, while a good video stream requires 100s of KB to tens of MBs per second. For video connections, the requirements add up with the number of participants and quickly reach the limits of slower internet connections. If the choppiness reduces when video is turned off, it indicates an issue with network bandwith. Bandwidth has a weakest link problem, it is limited by the slowest element in the connection between the participants. For example, if a computer is tethered to the internet connection of a mobile phone, the wifi connection between the computer and the phone may look faster than the internet connection speed of the phone which then becomes the bottleneck. Most commonly, bandwidth at the internet provider is quite reliable and fast, so that the limits should be located between the internet access point and the computer.\nFor wifi connections, make sure there is plenty of reserve bandwidth above that constantly needed for conferencing. Other applications also use bandwidth. Loading a larger web page can be demonstrated to temporarily cause choppy video in a conference. As a rule of thumb, wifi should be at least at 100MB per second, ideally way higher. Keep in mind that wifi speed drops as the distance to the access point increases. Moving around the house or cafe may affect the available bandwidth. Phone internet connections are suitable for one-to-ones. For more participants, they can quickly exhaust network bandwidth and may rack up volume-based data fees. They also make everybody else’s experience miserable because the camera usually zooms in on your nose hair. Wired network connections are great because they do not degrade with distance and provide fast, consistent speed. One check for potential wifi issues is to temporarily connect the computer to the internet access point using a network cable and see if the conference quality improves. Latency, or network delay, is also a potential problem. It is usually low enough for wifi and wired internet connections and can be low to horrendous on mobile. There is not much that can be done about it from the users side.\nNetwork stability (basically all aspects in how your network connection quality may change while the conference is in progress) can become a real nuisance. Especially for longer video conferences like the 8-hour one I just attended a lot of disturbances can happen. For example, a badly shielded vacuum cleaner may interfere with wireless network. Murphy’s law has it that your neighbour will always start vacuuming 10 minutes into the call. Another interference may be network traffic by other users. Wifi bandwidth is shared and can be eaten up if family members create a lot of other traffic. Reducing the Netflix subscription to only one stream may help here :-) In general, relying on bandwidth to be constantly available is a bit risky. Also here, using a wired connection circumvents some of the problems, since it (usually) does not share bandwidth with other computers on the local network.\nAs a good rule of thumb, more bandwidth (a faster internet connection) is always better, and wired network beats everything in terms of consistent quality and stability. Go wired or sit close to the wifi access point.\nVideo Video depends mostly on hardware and system load, provided the computer can handle processing the …","date":1584356400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1768398045,"objectID":"3f3645bd62279c72436fa0cdfc1d5e1c","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2020-03-15-how-to-video-conference/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-03-15-how-to-video-conference/","section":"post","summary":"We are video conferencing day-in day-out now.

Communities with a small number of participants typically organise informally. As the community grows, the need for coordination grows as well and at some point, a more structured organisation becomes necessary. The growth stages are defined by the coordination mechanisms applied – ad-hoc coordination for the initial small group, consensus focused auto-organisation for the medium sized group, and structured, more formalised coordination for the large sized group. The main interest of the communities is to attract and retain contributors and to facilitate contributions to their products. The communities studied in this qualitative embedded multiple-case study, exhibit governance related debates and conflicts, as they reached a large size, leading to difficulties in further growing the number of involved contributors and sustaining the community activities. The paper researches the emergence of governance norms in these communities and the role these norms, once established, play in the management of the communities in their then current stage. The study finds that the governance norms in communities are commonly developed by participants that do not think them necessary, for a community that does not want them at the time. The result is frequently implicit, under-documented norms that increase barriers to entry for newcomers and allow incumbent contributors the instruments to derail unwanted decisions. The paper focuses on the essential contradiction between the communities’ aim to maintain devolved authority at the contributor level and a requirement for effective decision making and policing mechanisms to implement and maintain that. It recommends that communities, instead of deferring or down-playing the need to set up explicit governance norms, purposefully develop norms that explicitly define structure and processes so that they support, enforce and protect the devolved authority their participants should have and encourages new participants.","tags":["FOSS","KDE","FSFE"],"title":"The emergence of governance norms in volunteer-driven open source communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mirko Boehm"],"categories":null,"content":"The OpenForum Academy held its second 2019 workshop in Brussels this week. OpenForum Academy is a European-based independent think tank which explains the merits of openness in computing to policy makers, industry and communities across Europe. This workshop series aims at being a forum for practitioners, academics and policy makers to collaborate on various topics of openness and freedom. It is organized by OpenForum Europe, enabling it to bridge between the abstract academic world and policy discussions at the European Commissions. We set out to explore focus topics to answer current challenges to openness that the academy will develop insights and recommendations for. These topics will shape the work of OpenForum Academy for the near future.\nThe workshop was opened by a series of input presentations. One of those was on “Addressing lock-in challenges through the use of open source software projects” by Björn Lundell, a fellow of the academy and professor at the University of Skövde in Sweden. He explained for example the need for open source solutions to read and write data formats of digital assets of long-term importance.1\nStandard and File Format Lock-In I presented key findings and recommendations from the study on “The Role of Open Source Software in Standard Setting”. All this served to frame the following discussion of potential core topics for the OpenForum Academy to focus. OpenForum Europe champions openness in Europe, a topic that has sprawled into numerous debates. Which ones of those are important and warrant the development of academic papers and policy briefs?\nExploring modern dimensions of openness Personally, I am primarily interested in Open Source aspects. However, there are other dimensions of openness that cover different processes and results. There is still a discussion of what an open standard is. Open hardware works quite differently to software, because the open specifications eventually have to be turned into physical goods. Access to data is an angle independent from software, specifications and hardware, and most software is made useful by the data sets it processes. We want more scientific articles to be available under open access licenses, especially when they are creating with public funding. The list of topics related to openness is probably never-ending. Eventually, the following aspects emerged as the currently most interesting ones:\nOpenness and the Cloud How the transition of ICT to cloud and edge services changes the importance of FOSS and data unsurprisingly sparked a heated debate during the workshop. Is software freedom threatened by the rise of cloud computing because software modifications are not required to be shared? How can vendor lock-in and a lack of choice be overcome? Very importantly, what is new about cloud that is different to before (hint: it may be less than we think)? How can consumer interests be protected and a healthy business ecosystem promoted? How can regulation help and where does regulation overreach (think surveillance or user profiling)? Many of these questions are about finding the right balance, or identifying the justified intrusions into the user’s rights to confidentiality and privacy.\nOpen Source as Civil ICT Infrastructure The EU invests in railroads, highways and data networks. Why does it not invest much into FOSS? FOSSA (hint: please participate in the survey!) is a good start. Much more could be done. Civil society is stepping in to take over public functions, as in the preservation of knowledge fostered by Wikipedia or Software Heritage, often with little public support. What would be a framework under which the EU and member states can invest into FOSS development, to serve it’s own needs or to support support sustainability goals? Can a public investment plan be developed for the development of OSS ICT infrastructure, including goals and spends?\nCommercial Business Models and Open Source Much has been discussed recently about the sustainability of FOSS development, often confusing it the viability of the own business model. Norms that form the pillars of the FOSS movement like the four freedoms of software or the Open Source Definition embody community culture at the expense of legalistic terminology. Recently, models have emerged that remove some of the freedoms guaranteed by those norms, for example in the deceptively named Commons Clause License. The relation between FOSS and other rights like trademarks or patents is still a much researched topic. Directly related to that are approaches on how to valuate FOSS and FOSS based businesses to give guidance to industry, VCs and policy makers for investment decisions. Some of our fellows feel it is important to take a stand as a community, insist on making it clear what FOSS really is and prevent a watering down of standards like the Open Source Definition.

OIN is the largest patent non-aggression community in history with over 2.600 community member companies. It’s mission is to protect core Open Source technologies from patent litigation. It shapes the norms of collaboration as Open Source becomes more industrial and the edge between free and proprietary software becomes increasingly important. Many key innovators license their patent portfolio through OIN, including Google, IBM, NEC, Philip, Red Hat, Sony, SUSE and Toyota. Until now however, one party was missing from the community that became an increasingly important contributor to Open Source technologies, and that was Microsoft. This gap closes today. I believe this is a historic moment that will encourage innovation and dramatically reduces risks for the wider Open Source community.\nI am a Free Software contributor for more than twenty years. Contributing for me was always about working towards the creation of a large body of Free and Open Source Software that benefits everybody. It was never about working against something or some entity. Later, I started presenting about Free Software arguing that “companies are community”, a notion that at the time caused concern with many long-term Free Software contributors. For me, this emphasizes that the Open Source way is about working towards open collaboration with all interested contributors.\nWhen Free Software emerged, it was a strong competitor for all incumbent proprietary software vendors, and Microsoft was one of the largest of them. Some initial conflict was inevitable. However, attitudes change and everybody learns. Eventually, Microsoft rather impressively reinvented itself as an important Open Source contributor. The announcement today is a culmination of the process that completes for patent licensing what began with code releases and major contributions to various projects. Today, Linux based workloads on Azure are quite common. For Microsoft, joining OIN resolves an inherent conflict that existed as a leftover from the transition to being a major Free Software contributor: If technologies are developed collaboratively, the contributors should exercise joint stewardship over the result that is released under an Open Source license. Extracting license revenue from such collaboratively developed Open Source technology creates a rift and undermines collaboration. By “making peace with the free world” and joining OIN, Microsoft may pre-empt it’s own patent licensing revenue for Android and other technologies covered by the OIN Linux System definition, but it gains significant reputation and acceptance in the wider Open Source community. Since this is where software innovation is happening, the long-term benefits of this strategy should outweigh the cost by far.\nFor Open Invention Network, today’s news are a major step forward. Membership in the OIN community is free of charge. All participants cross-license their patent portfolio within the field-of-use definition of core Open Source technologies. It is not necessary to hold a patent portfolio to join OIN. This means everybody in the network immediately benefits from the new cross-licensing commitment of over 60.000 patents made by Microsoft. A network like OIN becomes more and more valuable the more patents are cross-licensed and the more software technologies are covered by that (a network effect :-). With Microsoft on board, it should be even more obvious that joining OIN is the best and also the easiest way to enter the patent “no-fly zone” over Linux. This benefits Open Source innovation and the wider Open Source community, which in turn contributes Free Software to the common good. Everybody wins.\n","date":1539183600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558006438,"objectID":"90eb16b4eccfec402113d6fe0ce26b49","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2018-microsoft-joins-oin/","publishdate":"2018-10-10T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-microsoft-joins-oin/","section":"post","summary":"Today, Microsoft and Open Invention Network (OIN) announced that Microsoft has become a member of the OIN community.

The workshop took place in Brussels on September 18, 2018. I presented a set of observations from the research on the case studies performed as part of the project that are outlined below. Other speakers where Catharina Maracke on the issue of legal compliance between Open Source and FRAND licenses, Bruce Perens on “Community Dynamics in Open Source”, and Andy Updegrove on “Dynamics in Standardisation”.\nYou may ask what the relevance of this debate is for the wider Free and Open Source Software community. The obvious answer is that to distribute software “without restriction”, the user needs all the usage rights associated with the program. While most FOSS contributors assume that this is naturally the central motivation for anybody to contribute in the first place, there is a long history of attempts to maintain some sort of exclusive control over a piece of FOSS code, possibly using other rights than copyright.\nContributor license agreements (CLA) are a well known instrument for that. The original author agrees to an exclusive or non-exclusive license to a central entity (usually a community organisation or a dominating company) to use their work. This may just give a community organisation a right to adopt newer licenses. Or it may give a single Open Source vendor the right to use other contributor’s work commercially. Whether CLA embody FOSS culture or violate them by creating an asymmetric distribution of benefits between contributors and a company therefore depends on the specific terms of the CLA. The contributor agreements configurator helps projects to set up a CLA and understand what the motivation behind the terms are (Endocode contributed the implementation). CLA are controversial, especially if they include copyright assignments to a single company. Projects and contributors are well-advised to make sure to fully understand what they are agreeing to. The main take-away for the argument here is that the norm in FOSS communities is a symmetric distribution of rights between all contributors, and CLA are one instrument to modify this to the benefit of a single entity.\nBut that is not all. It just helps to explain how such asymmetric rights can be used to give a single entity more power in a community of contributors. There is a long history of such attempts, and they usually involve some other legal rights beyond the terms of the FOSS license applied. There is a good reason for that: FOSS licenses give contributors and users a time-tested and well-balanced framework for collaboration. “Use, study, modify, redistribute” is a simple, easy to understand mantra that every FOSS contributor knows and understands. CLA augment the FOSS license terms with an additional contractual agreement, but for the most part stay in the realm of copyright just like FOSS licenses. Other instruments not so much:\nTrademarks are used to enforce a vendor’s expectations when others adopt and ship their software. This is used by communities to protect their names, like in the Mozilla Trademark Policy, or to make sure specific services are included in devices, like in the Android Compatibility Program. Trade secrets like delayed code releases under FOSS licenses or proprietary “extensions” that are effectively required for the software to be useful are used to maintain an edge of an “enterprise” version over the FOSS release. The software patents debate may have slowed down, but is still relevant. Patents exist, and applications for patents that include claims that are implemented in existing FOSS solutions never stopped. It has become harder to be granted a patent for a software-only solution. Institutions like the Open Invention Network create a safe space where FOSS innovators cross-license freely and avoid litigation. However vendors shipping FOSS in products still need to clear potential patent claims implemented in those. Conformance with patents does not usually follow from FOSS licenses. Which leads to round five of the match with software freedom in one corner and exclusivity in the other – standard-essential patents (SEP). Everybody loves standards, and FOSS especially: We use standardised programming languages, unicode tables and system call interfaces. Standards are the foundation for interoperability, and some standards like the Open Document Format are the result of a long struggle to establish formats that re-open markets for competition. All of these standards are Open Standards that can be implemented in FOSS without restrictions. But what if implementing a standard would be required to interoperate with others, or even mandatory under existing …","date":1537574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572468027,"objectID":"81a0b3373712686014aa0189ea2ee6a5","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2018-jrc-workshop/","publishdate":"2018-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-jrc-workshop/","section":"post","summary":"As part of the research project on “The Interaction between Open Source Software and FRAND licensing in Standardisation”, a workshop was organised by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC) in collaboration with Directorate General Communications Networks, Content and Technology (CONNECT) to present and discuss the intermediate results to date.

The workshop moderators have extensive experience in FOSS compliance issues, from both a legal and a technical perspective, within the framework of the Linux Foundation’s OpenChain as well as the Quartermaster Compliance Tooling project.\nObtaining OpenChain compliance is a daunting task, for industrial or even ICT-based companies who have been working with open source for some time, have entrenched development, sales and distribution practices, and no real idea or control over FOSS usage. It requires not just a superficial documentary process (getting the license information, finding the source code) but a “sea” change in quality assurance processes in the company. OpenChain focuses on roles, processes (and artefacts). The combination with Quartermaster helps in achieving compliance by automating “best practises”.\nThe workshop will focus on the objectives of the OpenChain conformance work at a client, the planning and processes involved, and challenges met so far based on real life experience. We want to share materials we are using, work on creating better model documentation for this type of activity, and discuss and eventually publish “best” practices, and are looking forward to hearing, and building, on the experiences of the workshop attendees.\nThis workshop will not just be a presentation of materials, cases and examples by the moderators, but requires active input from attendees to suggest new methods of achieving compliance, creating improved documentation and processes that can be shared with the community. We hope to benchmark typical scenarios and challenges and find responses for them.\nThis section of the workshop will lead into the the subsequent session during which automation and technological facilitation of the compliance process will be demonstrated and explored based on the Quartermaster toolchain. The session will demonstrate how to instrument software builds to gather essential compliance data, run standard and custom analysis to identify licenses, authors, copyright holders or compliance with company policies, and then generate up-to-date, accurate and complete reports for distribution with the product as well as to give feedback to software developers about detected compliance issues or quality metrics.\nWho: The workshop moderators include OpenChain Partners who are also partners at their law firms advising clients on open source legal issues, as well as FOSS compliance tool makers. It is aimed at any individual involved in implementing or advising on open source compliance (and not just in the “supply chain”).\nWhy attend: Through this workshop, you will not only gain a fuller understanding of the OpenChain specification itself, but also see what materials for OC conformance are available, and, in conjunction with the subsequent session, get a view on some tools that are being used (or built!), work on your own or shared materials.\n","date":1528972200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675349677,"objectID":"03434a8f51e756aae8251a9d927c85bc","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/talk/2018-foss-backstage/","publishdate":"2018-06-14T10:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-foss-backstage/","section":"talk","summary":"Malcolm Bain, Andrew Katz and I presented a workshop at FOSS Backstage 2018 (also the first FOSS Backstage event) in Berlin in June 2018.

This software drives innovation and enables everybody to access and use computers, whether or not they can afford new hardware or commercial software. So that’s that, the benefit to society is obvious. Everybody should just get behind it and support it. Right? Well, it is not that easy. Especially when it comes to principles of individual freedom or trade-offs between self-determination and convenience, it is difficult to communicate the message in a way that it reaches and activates a wider audience. How can we explain the difference between Free Software and services available at no cost (except them spying at you) best? Campaigning for software freedom is not easy. However, it is part of the Free Software Foundation Europe’s mission. The FSFE teamed up with Peng! Collective to learn how to run influential campaigns to promote the cause of Free Software. The Peng Collective is a Berlin based group of activists who are known for their successful and quite subversive campaigns for political causes. And Endocode? Endocode is a sponsor of the Free Software Foundation Europe. We are a sponsor because free software is essential to us, both as a company and as members of society. And so here we are.\nSuper secret conspiracy workshop There are some exciting, courageous and engaging campaigns that focus on communicating complex political goals. The escape helpers campaign leaves the audience conflicted between the two choices of being a good human rights activists (driven by ideals and demonstrating solidarity with refugees) and being a good citizen (by abiding to the law). Great, because the message is to re-think what is legal against what is right. The #slamshell performance emotionally demonstrated the risks associated with oil drilling that are normally regarded as marginal.\nThese campaigns translate abstract, distant risks or worries into concrete, tangible calls to action. By being provocative, they break the mold and reach a wide audience online and through traditional media. They are “cat content for social change”, as our tutors put it. Campaigners are being urged to stop preaching or complaining and to start using positive communication combined with subversive PR work instead. Such messaging needs punchlines, which requires some kind of hyperbole - dadaism, hijacking attention, or provocation.\nCampaign development is still a pretty down to earth task. Through fact finding research and the analysis of campaign goals, supporting allies and potential opponents, answers to the four essential questions are being narrowed down: What is the change that we want to achieve? How can this change be brought about? Who can make that change we want to see? And who has power over the involved people or groups? Setting campaign goals is often a compromise between achieving big changes locally or small changes “globally”. It helps to envision the impact of the campaign through utopia/dystopia brainstorms: What would a world look like where all campaign goals have been achieved perfectly? What would it look like if everything went horribly wrong? These kind of mental exercises also help to explain the relevance of the campaign goals and show how the intended change can affect people’s lives. The goals may be perfectly obvious to those passionate about them already, but not to outsiders - a common problem regarding the ethics and ideals of Free Software.\nImplementing a campaign involves many standard, by the book project management tasks. The individual publicity stunts and activities are the actions that form the campaign timeline. A dilemma specific to the FSFE is that the relevant and influential media - social networks especially - are the kind of centralized proprietary platforms against which we are advocating. However, we learned that it may be possible to play this situation to our advantage :-) Since the FSFE’s goals require some heavy lifting of Free Software lobbying, the campaign timeline extends far into the future. We found ourselves thinking about what to present at conferences a year or more into the future. Finalizing the campaign plan involves answering the “classical” question of what time, material and talent is required to perform the tasks, and to put them into a timeline. Often this includes outside help for extra manpower or professional expertise. Noticeably, those with technical backgrounds tend to haste towards a release, underestimating the lead time required to get there, and the duration of the campaign. This tendency works almost, but not quite, entirely unlike in software projects. Securing and confirming the support of allies and protagonists also takes time.\nThe planned actions need to be reviewed with a focus group that resembles or at least understands the target audience.

To illustrate how this problem would be solved and to jump right into using ThreadWeaver, let’s simulate this problem by printing Hello World!1 as the asynchronous payload:\n#include \u0026lt;QtCore\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;ThreadWeaver/ThreadWeaver\u0026gt; int main(int argc, char** argv) { QCoreApplication app(argc, argv); using namespace ThreadWeaver; stream() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; make_job( []() { qDebug() \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;; } ); } This short but complete program written in C++11 outputs the common greeting to the command line.2 It does so, however, from a worker thread managed by the global ThreadWeaver queue. The header file ThreadWeaver/ThreadWeaver included in line 2 contains the essential declarations needed to use the most common ThreadWeaver operations. The components used in this examples are the global queue, a job and a queueing mechanism. The global queue is a singleton instance of the ThreadWeaver thread pool that is instantiated when it it first accessed after the application starts. A job represents “something” that should be executed asynchroneously. In this case, the thing to execute is a C++ lambda function that prints the welcome message. The queueing mechanism used here is a queue stream, an API inspired by the iostream family of classes. ThreadWeaver builds on top of Qt, and similar to most Qt applications requires a QCoreApplication (or one of its descendants) to exist throughout the lifetime of the application. Up to line 7, the program looks like any other Qt application.\nTo have the job lambda function called by one of the worker threads, a job is created that wraps it using the make_job(). It is then handed to the queue stream. The queue stream will submit the jobs for execution when the queuing command is completed, that is at the closing semicolon. Once the job is queued, one of the worker threads will automatically pick it up from the queue and execute it. ThreadWeaver::Job is the unit of execution handled by ThreadWeaver queues. Jobs are simple runnable types that perform one task, defined in their run() method. Some jobs wrap a lambda function as in this example or decorate other jobs. However implementing custom, reusable job classes is only a matter of writing a class that inherits ThreadWeaver::Job and re-implementing it’s run method. The job that was created by make_job() in this example wraps the specified lambda function, and executes it when it is itself executed by a worker thread.\nThe program does not specify where the job should be executed, and not even when exactly. In a scenario where there would be many jobs waiting in the queue, execution of the new job would not be immediate. Which worker thread will be assigned the job is also undefined. The programmer gives up a bit of control over the details of execution, and in turns benefits from the automatic distribution of jobs amongst the available processors by the worker threads in the queue. Every program that links the ThreadWeaver library has access to a global queue for the execution of jobs. If no queue is specified when enqueueing a job, the global one will be used by default. Workers threads are allocated when needed by the queue. If the global pool is never accessed by an application, it will never be instantiated.\nAn application performing tasks in background threads should never exit while any of these operations is still in progress. In the case of ThreadWeaver, this means all jobs in the queue need to be either completed or dequeued and all worker threads idle before the application may exit. The global pool is in fact a QObject child of the QCoreApplication object instantiated in line 7. It will be deleted by the destructor of QCoreApplication. When it is destroyed, it will wait until all queued up jobs have completed. The program will thus wait in line 8 until the job has finished printing “Hello World!” and will then exit. The job was enqueued as a shared pointer, so memory management is taken care of. While this example was very much simplified, the described functionality already has many practical applications. For example, the many operations real-life applications need to perform at startup, like loading translations, icon resources et cetera, can be removed from the criticial path this way. In this case the operations usually need to be performed in a certain order and then handed over to the main thread. Solutions for that are built into ThreadWeaver as well.\nSince there have been questions - the title of the post refers to the problem of writing output from multiple threads without synchronization, which breaks the guarantees on …","date":1407772800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1768398045,"objectID":"76909da9cdb949bf9549648ed0f75212","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2014-08-11-helw-olorld/","publishdate":"2014-08-11T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2014-08-11-helw-olorld/","section":"post","summary":"Concurrent programming means creating applications that perform multiple operations at the same time.

The new frameworks are drop-in extensions to Qt applications, with minimal and well-documented dependencies for easier deployment. The tech preview contains two frameworks that are marked as mature, namely KArchive and ThreadWeaver. The updated ThreadWeaver was my major piece of library coding work in 2013, and was finished just in time for the release. Even though it is a tech preview, it is stable, and no major (or even significant but minor) changes in the current API are expected until the final release. Programmers are already encouraged to use it, and provide feedback and bug reports.\nThreadWeaver is a concurrent execution scheduler written in C++. Available for all target platforms of the Qt framework, including desktop, mobile and embedded environments, ThreadWeaver delivers concurrent execution of tasks, load balancing with regard to user-defined criteria, multiple independent queues, processing graph modelling, aggregate jobs and other comprehensive features. As all other KDE frameworks, ThreadWeaver is Free Software. Its only dependency is Qt, which makes it a tier 1 framework in KDE’s lingo.1\nA number of the new features of ThreadWeaver were announced at Akademy 2013. Jobs, the unit of concurrent execution in ThreadWeaver, are now managed by the queue using shared pointers, meaning that auto-delete behaviour is implicit and controlled by the user. Helper templates are available to queue stack or member variables, so allocation of jobs can be static or dynamic. Functors or lambda functions can be used to construct jobs. Job aggregates like collections and sequences now execute their own run() method before queueing their elements, so that aggregates can generate their own elements. Success and queueing state of jobs are now integrated into a single status. Jobs can signal the result of execution by setting a status, but also using exceptions, simplifying error reporting in more complex job classes. Jobs can be decorated, and no more inherit QObject by default. Decorators can be used to add signals, change priorities or modify just about any behaviour of jobs independently of the actual job class used. The construction of the global queue can now be customised using a queue factory. The QueueStream API greatly simplifies queueing jobs with a familiar iostream-like C++ syntax.\nThreadWeaver follows the Unix idiom of doing one thing, and doing it right. Similar to how small Unix programs can be combined to create an practically infinite space of computing solutions, ThreadWeaver offers itself to programmers as an add-on module with minimal dependencies. Including it extends an application with concurrent scheduling capability. But the same Unix idiom is also applied in a second sense. Within ThreadWeaver, a few basic concepts – jobs and their aggregates, queues and policies – are implemented that again provide simple building blocks that can be combined creatively, offering a vast space of potential solutions within the scope of the application.\nThe history of ThreadWeaver goes back to KDE 3. The idea of implementing a thread pool based execution scheduler that manages dependencies between jobs was implemented as a proof of concept using Qt 3. However it turned out to be difficult to implement and use because of the lack of thread-safe reference counting of the implicitly shared classes at the time. These fundamental problems have been solved with the release of Qt 4. Additionally, the introduction of cross-thread signal-slot connections further simplified the communication between jobs and the application’s user interface. The first production ready version of ThreadWeaver was released as part of KDELibs with KDE 4.0. For KDE Frameworks 5, it was almost completely re-written to simplify memory management of jobs, make use of new Qt 5 features like atomic variables, and in part to reflect new language constructs in C++11 like lambda functions. ThreadWeaver comes with an extensive set of unit tests that all pass in the tech preview (hear, hear).\nIn the following weeks and months, the framework will be polished and debugged based on user feedback. Also, a series of posts here on this blog will introduce individual ThreadWeaver concepts and features in depth, mostly based on example programs, including contrasting it to thread handling in Qt using QThread or Qt Concurrent. ThreadWeaver is very close to production quality, having been tested continuously in the last couple of months. There may still be smaller, source compatible changes to the framework. We ask interested programmers out there to provide feedback and bug reports to make ThreadWeaver what it should be – a worry-free, easy to use and powerful add-on to Qt that programmers enjoy using.

Da sich die Teilnehmer ihre Seminare nach eigenem Interesse selbst aussuchen, fand sich ein bunte Mischung von Medizinern über Naturwissenschaftlern bis zu Theologen zusammen. Die Verbindung aus Neugier, Heterogenität der Gruppe und inspirierender Umgebung sorgte für explosive Debatten, hitzige Diskussionsrunden und eine wie Flug vergangene Woche.\nSchwerpunkte des Seminars waren die Fragen, wie Open-Source-Communities eigentlich funktionieren, was Einzelne zur Mitwirkung motiviert, wie sich freie Produkte in die Wirtschaftsordnung integrieren und welche politischen Herausforderungen und Veränderungen zu bewältigen sind. Während schnell Einverständnis herrschte darüber, das der Open Source Way ein gesellschaftliches und kein technisches Problem ist, wurde zu anderen sonst in der Netzgemeinde als selbstverständlich vermutete Ansichten wie “das Internet gehört den Benutzern” gut argumentiert hinterfragt. Wer trägt die Verantwortung für durch unvorsichtige Bewertungen beschädigte Reputation, muss alle Teilhabe in Zukunft im Netz stattfinden, braucht es eine Internetpolizei, das Strafrecht der realen Welt erweiternde Sanktionen, die Regulierung des Netzes? Durch die diversen Blickwinkel war manchmal nicht klar, wer mehr von wem lernte, die Seminarleitung oder die Teilnehmer.\nKarsten Gerloff berichtete über die politische Bedeutung von Freier Software und offener Innovation, die Bedrohung durch Softwarepatente und die Kampagnenarbeit der FSFE.\nPaul, Karsten und Mirko bei der Sommeruni Die Beschäftigung mit der Materie war dabei von deutlicher Ernsthaftigkeit geprägt. Zum Beispiel brauchten die Teilnehmer etwa fünf Minuten, um den systematischen Unterschied bei der Integration von Copyleft- oder Permissive-lizensierten Beiträgen zu verstehen - ein Prozess, der bei nicht wenigen Freie-Software-Communities entweder gar nicht oder erst recht spät verstanden wird. Paul Adams war sichtlich beeindruckt.

Free Software platforms like KDE or Android are open to all actors without discrimination and at extremely low barriers of entry. The fact that Free Software solutions offer attractive alternatives to proprietary closed-source offerings makes it more competitive, not less.\nKDE is one of the largest volunteer-driven Free Software1 communities. The KDE community builds a free platform to create user experiences for desktop, mobile and other devices, and invites individuals and companies to extend and build upon this platform. Our community is a world-wide collaboration of companies and individuals that together create programs in an openly governed development process. Millions of users benefit from the programs that are distributed under a Free Software license that guarantees the Four Freedoms of software. This license means that our users and contributors together create a public good that others can redistribute or build upon.\nThe KDE Community calls on the European Commission to very carefully analyze the Fairsearch complaint for attempts to reduce the strong competition of Free Software platforms like KDE or Android to proprietary non-free offerings. We encourage the European Commission to understand that Free Software truly fosters innovation and increases competition, and to protect the liberty of our contributors and those of other communities to collaboratively create and distribute Free Software as a common good.\nThe “Four Freedoms” force actors to compete within markets, not for control over markets Free Software provides a level playing field for all competitors. By minimizing barriers of entry and eliminating discrimination of access to formats, standards and technologies, Free Software platforms create comparable starting positions for all actors, leaving them with options to convince customers about (with) the functionality of their products and the quality of their services. Lock-in and artificial market segregation through discriminative licensing or essential technologies are systematically reduced. In fact, the most popular Free Software licence, the GPL, clearly forbids any kind of discrimination of use.\nConsumers benefit from this openness by having choice between multiple interoperable products and by lower prices through increased competition. This is because Free Software implies open standards accessible to any party willing to implement them. The Free Software nature of the platforms fosters the proliferation of technical understanding and skills, improving the chances for the development of a more diverse, less concentrated technology business ecosystem. These concrete opportunities for economic development specifically in the European Union are endangered if Free Software platforms are penalized because of misunderstood complaints of predatory pricing.\nThe claim of anti-competitiveness of Free Software platforms is untenable. Even in the extraordinary situation where only one entity contributes to development, the licenses under which the products are distributed explicitly rule out almost all typical forms of anti-competitive behaviour like exclusive dealing (for example through selective partnership licensing programs), any kind of fixed or barrier pricing or territorial divisions often employed by proprietary vendors. While trademarks can be used to limit platform fragmentation, they will not leverage control over competing products based on the Free Software platform itself. For example, Kindle Fire and Facebook Phone are products build upon the Android Open Source Project platform without any further restrictions.\nBecause the open, competitive nature of Free Software platform fosters confidence in users and vendors that the risk of undue lock-in is minimal, an obvious trend towards de facto standardization on open platforms is observable in many technological fields including the mobile space. Since actors are usually not inclined to voluntarily return to the strong lock-in of proprietary platforms, vendors of proprietary platforms have shown a tendency towards hampering the emergence of Free Software platforms by spreading “FUD” (fear, uncertainty and doubt). Volunteer-driven Free Software communities rely on regulators to identify these attempts and to provide protection of open innovation against the vested interest of strong proprietary players.\nConclusion - Free Software platforms are competitive by nature The KDE Community is asking the European Commission to protect the liberty to develop and distribute platforms under accepted Free Software licenses providing the Four Freedoms to all potential users and to derivative works, and to recognize the overwhelming benefit to the public provided by open and collaborative innovation …","date":1378310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568369929,"objectID":"bd063aad342ea56afa999ac7fa493391","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2013-09-kde-nope-to-fairsearch/","publishdate":"2013-09-04T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2013-09-kde-nope-to-fairsearch/","section":"post","summary":"The KDE community is deeply concerned by the wrong notion contained in the recent complaint by the Fairsearch initiative claiming that “distribution of Android at below-cost” could constitute anti-competitive behaviour or predatory pricing.","tags":["FOSS","KDE","netzpolitik"],"title":"KDE rejects Fairsearch initiative claims: Free Software is competitive","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mirko Boehm"],"categories":null,"content":"tl;dr: If you are a committed KDE contributor and not a KDE e.V. member, you are doing it wrong.

The highlights this year where the discussion of the role of the Community Working Group, the report on the first activities of the newly established Financial Working Group, and the election of one new board member. I was the chairperson of the assembly, and this is my inofficial report.\nThe role of KDE e.V. is somewhat described by “standing on the shoulders of giants”. It is made up by community members interested in governance matters, and represents the wider KDE community that encompasses all non-technical and technical contributors. On one hand KDE e.V. takes a passive stance, in that it does not directly influence the direction the development of KDE is taking. On the other hand it plays an important role and invariably influences the community by receicing donations, managing funding of development sprints and meetings, covering operational costs like hardware and infrastructure, and of course by running the Akademy conference year after year. This setup is reflected in the working groups that act as focal points for various fields of interest within the community. Working groups as established for marketing, system administration, community, user relations and finance. Notably absent is a development working group, it is commonly accepted that this is not KDE e.V.’s concern. The membership elects a five person board that coordinates the work of the KDE e.V. members and the working groups. KDE e.V. currently has 169 active members, which is an impressive number considering it’s non-technical focus in a development community.\nThe abbreviation “e.V.” stands for “eingetragener Verein”, German for “registered association”. It functions much like a shareholders company in which every member holds exactly one share. This means the membership as a whole is the proprietor of all assets owned by the KDE community, including the KDE trademark and the operational infrastructure. A new member joins the group of joint owners of KDE - quite a responsibility. Dictated by the principle of congruence of power and responsibility the membership in turn assumes the right to allocate funds, elect representatives to related communities et cetera. Because of that, it is necessary that the KDE e.V. membership represents the community of KDE contributors as broadly as possible. Every committed KDE contributor is encouraged to seek membership. Send an email to the KDE community mailing list to express your interest to become a member (How to become a KDE e.V. member). Only individuals can be members, organizations are invited to become supporting members. As a bonus, supporting members are invited to attend the general assembly.\nThis year’s assembly started routinely with the report of the board and the different working groups. Official meeting minutes will be published later, but it is fair to say that KDE’s house is generally in good order. The board is focused on the transition of the KDE community to an umbrella for various Free Software efforts as described in the KDE Manifesto. As projects join the KDE Community, the existing structure of internal representation needs to be updated to reflect the interests of these sub-communities. As everything in KDE this is a work in progress, the first step look rather promising. The marketing working group is preparing a campaign to advertise the use of the upcoming KDE frameworks on top of Qt. The treasurer and the auditors of the accounting reported a small surplus in the fiscal year of 2012 that will be used to fund additional KDE activities in 2013. Spending is well aligned with KDE e.V.’s goal and tightly supervised. A new system of accounts and cost codes will provide better insight in the income and expenses incurred by the various activities and events.\nThe mission of the User Working Group established in 2012 is the give KDE users a representation within the community and involve them more in KDE development. This effort still needs more pickup. Growing the role of the User Working Group is very important, since the strength of Free Software is only realised by users and developers forming the communities together. It will need a charter, user representatives to KDE e.V., and routine activities of involving KDE users in development and quality improvement efforts.\nThe Community Working …","date":1374163200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569162431,"objectID":"c7f1b5befbd6cae0676efc389075b03e","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2013-07-18-kde-ga/","publishdate":"2013-07-18T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2013-07-18-kde-ga/","section":"post","summary":"tl;dr: If you are a committed KDE contributor and not a KDE e.V. member, you are doing it wrong.

KDE is headed to morph into an umbrella community for similarily minded end-user focused Free Software projects, based on a set of shared values and ideals. Being an ex long-time KDE e.V. board member inevitably provides a certain high level perspective on governance related matters, and the presentation focused on providing food for thought for this process. It was the conference where we drafted the KDE Manifesto. After long consideration, it was published later in 2012 and represents an excellent summary of what the community and it’s contributors believe in. Kudos again to all who contributed to that, especially Kevin Ottens.\nToo much of community building, politico-economic analysis and meta-thinking is not good for mental health (besides, I do a lot of that all year around at the Technical University of Berlin). So for this year, the goal was to go back to the basics, and take part in the ongoing work to modernize KDE’s frameworks by refactoring and updating Threadweaver. Real, actual lower-level coding work, also known as pure bliss. Threadweaver is KDE’s concurrency scheduler. It’s goal is provide an abstraction of multithreading and concurrency suitable for developers of end-user applications, and make it as simple as possible in the process. Threadweaver has been in KDE since 4.0, but C++ idioms and Qt, which it builds upon, have evolved dramatically since KDE 4 was first released. So an update was in order. The development work on the new version of the Threadweaver core is mostly complete, and ready to be introduced at Akademy (all changes are in the kdelibs repository, for the curious). The presentation is suitable for newcomers as well, and will contain a programming introduction, a chapter on Threadweaver’s philosophy and concept, and a discussion of performance considerations.\nI am writing this post on the direct flight from Berlin to Bilbao that I reached after a bit of an eventfull journey to the airport. Expecting that an nice extra 15 minutes buffer time to account for the unexpected should be plenty, the taxi driver got pulled over by the police for driving at ludicrous speed (31 km/h in a 20 km/h zone), then navigated around a traffic jam at a construction site, and got delayed again when a scenic tour bus got stuck after thinking it would be a great idea to pass through a single lane road that was about three centimeters wider than the bus itself (a road which, of course, we had to pass from the other direction). I got to the airport just in time for boarding and leisurely strolled onto the plane, since I was already boarded. Should have accounted for 20 minutes of unexpected events, bad planning on my part, I guess. However, the headphones are playing Telegraph Road by the Dire Straits, and I am going to Akademy.

Praktisch wird die Software aber nahezu ausschliesslich zur Überwachung politisch unliebsamer Meinungen durch Ausspähen von Userdaten und Mithören von Kommunikation verwendet. Zivile Anwendungen sind zwar theoretisch möglich, aber auch mit Phantasie kaum vorstellbar.\nReporter ohne Grenzen fordert deshalb in einem Positionspapier zum Internet Governance Forum in Baku die Ausweitung des Geltungsbereichs von Rüstungsexportkontrollen auf Software, die zur Überwachung eingesetzt werden kann. Dies ist zu begrüssen, denn Überwachung ist ein Angriff auf Netzneutralität und eine freiheitliche Willensbildung. Aber es zeigt auch ein Dilemma auf: Während der Zensursula-Debatte und den Anti-ACTA-Protesten wurde deutlich herausgestellt, dass es dem Staat nicht zuzutrauen ist, zwischen guter und schlechter Internetnutzung zu unterscheiden. Insbesondere nicht, ohne diese Mittel zur politischen Einflussnahme zu missbrauchen. Ebenso sind Vertraulichkeit der Kommunikation und freier Zugang zu Verschlüsselungstechnologie stehende Forderungen der Netzgemeinde. Jetzt aber wird genau diese Unterscheidung in gute und schlechte Software vom Staat erwartet. Das Problem der Grenzziehung bleibt dabei bestehen - was, wenn der Staat die Kontrolle digitaler Rüstungsgüter zum Vorwand nimmt, die Verbreitung von Verschlüsselungstechnik zu beschränken und damit Überwachung zu ermöglichen?\nIm netzpolitischen Diskurs ist dieser Konflikt noch nicht zufriedenstellend aufgelöst. Es ist eine berechtigte Forderung, die Verbreitung jeglicher Art von Mitteln, die zur Einschränkung von Menschenrechten eingesetzt werden zu kontrollieren und möglichst zu verhindern. Es ist besonders eklig und mit dem Gerechtigkeitsempfinden in Deutschland nicht vereinbar, die Verbreitung digitaler Rüstungsgüter darüber hinaus noch mit Steuergeldern zu fördern. Die Bundesregierung ist aufgefordert, derartige Praxis zu unterbinden - wirtschaftliche Interessen dürfen nicht über die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte gestellt werden.\nAndererseits wird hier auch in der Netzpolitik deutlich, dass jede Freiheit ihre Grenzen an der Freiheit der anderen findet, und es deswegen hundertprozentige Freiheit nicht geben kann. Wenn die Durchsetzung von Freiheiten zur “Freiheit” von Schutz und Sicherheit führt, geht sie zu weit. Das an sich gesunde Misstrauen gegenüber der Kontrolle durch den Staat darf nicht dazu führen, dass dieser keine Massnahmen zur Gewährleistung der Grundrechte mehr implementieren kann.\nVielleicht können zwei weitere Mittel bei der Lösung des Problems helfen: Freie Software, und Freie Netze. Die Kontrolle der Verbreitung von Software steht ohnehin auf tönernen Füssen, da sie auf das eigene Hoheitsgebiet beschränkt ist. Den Unterdrückten ist mehr geholfen, wenn ihnen wirksame Mittel zur Gegenwehr zur Verfügung stehen. Durch Freie Software wird es ihnen ermöglicht, vertrauenswürdigere Systeme aufzubauen, bei denen es schwerer ist, Überwachungssysteme zum Beispiel bereits durch den Hersteller zu installieren. Freie Peer-to-Peer-Netztechnologie erlaubt den Aufbau von “Samisdat”-Netzen, welche die Great Firewall aushebeln. Auf diese Art erlangen Initiativen wie Freifunk eine politische Bedeutung als Mittel gegen Unterdrückung und Überwachung.\nDas Bedürfnis des Schutzes der Schwachen wird zum Prüfstein der Freiheitsforderungen in der Netzpolitik und zeigt auf, wie kleinlich die Diskussion um den “Klau” von Musikstücken durch Kinder ist.\nDieser Artikel ist ursprünglich erschienen auf netzpolitik.org. ↩︎\n","date":1352476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569157928,"objectID":"8547a7b798f4daa82c1e289fd054c243","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-11-09-deep-packet-inspection/","publishdate":"2012-11-09T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2012-11-09-deep-packet-inspection/","section":"post","summary":"Auf dem Netzpolitischen Abend des Digitalen Gesellschaft e.V. trug Christian Mihr von Reporter ohne Grenzen vorgestern zum Export von Überwachungssoftware deutscher Provenienz vor. “Made in Germany” steht für die zweifelhafte Errungenschaft, dass in Diktaturen Überwachungssoftware aus Deutschland eingesetzt wird, um politische Gegner zu verfolgen und Meinungsfreiheit zu unterdrücken.","tags":["FOSS","netzpolitik"],"title":"Deep Packet Inspection und Gute Software, schlechte Software","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mirko Boehm"],"categories":null,"content":"This week, Open Oil project performed a marvelous stunt - the “Oil Contracts Booksprint”.

Not only did such a book not exist, they also published it under a Creative Commons license. And because that is not enough of a challenge, they did it all in one week.\nOil Contracts - How to read and understand them Oil contracts determine the share of the oil revenue that the country who owns the oil, the international oil companies and others receive. From the book: “It is petroleum contracts that express how [the] money is split and who makes what profits, just as it is the contracts that determine who manages operations and how issues such as the environment, local economic development, and community rights are dealt with. The share price of ExxonMobil, the question of who carries responsibility for Deepwater Horizon, whether Uganda will be able to stop importing petrol, and how much it costs to heat and light homes in millions of homes ­­ these are issues which depend directly on clauses in the contracts signed between the governments of the world and the oil companies. For most of the 150 years of oil production, these contracts have remained hidden, nested in a broader secrecy that surrounded all aspects of the industry. Governments claimed national security prerogatives, companies said commercial sensitivity precluded making them available.”\nPeople who have attended an Open Source develoment sprint may notice that the desk in the picture pretty much looks like at one of them. A book sprint applies techniques and tools developed in the Open Source world to authoring. Gather the relevant people, get them to a remote location with little distraction, and then allow them to focus on producing something they are passionate about. As in software, the results are impressive. Collaborative editing tools are used to coordinate between authors, editors and illustrators, similar to version control. It is also noteworthy that of the different expert that attended the sprint, all attended on a pro-bono basis or as part of their day job.\nThe “How to understand an oil contract” book is a good read even for people who are only casually interested in the politics of oil. How the book was produced serves as a great example of the Open Source way adopted by other, less technology related sectors. And if the book contributes to making oil contracts better understood and more comparable, the world has just become a better place.\n","date":1352218130,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566660664,"objectID":"0d6923ec510a04efbd5d25d3799e71c8","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-openoil-book/","publishdate":"2012-11-06T18:08:50+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2012-openoil-book/","section":"post","summary":"This week, Open Oil project performed a marvelous stunt - the “Oil Contracts Booksprint”.

Naturgemäß ging es vorrangig um Freie Software, die Ökonomie des Internets, kreative Zerstörung und die digitale Gesellschaft. So ist hoffentlich für jeden was dabei. Der Beitrag ist zugegebenermassen etwas länglich, weil er sich am Inhalt des Workshops orientiert.1\nDas Internet bewirkt vor allem eine Veränderung im Umgang mit Informationen - sie sind jederzeit verfügbar, von zunehmend hoher Qualität, und es können wesentlich mehr Informationen in der gleicher Zeit verarbeitet werden. Was bedeuten diese technischen Offensichtlichkeiten für das Wirtschaften? Dazu ist es notwendig, sich Voraussetzungen für das Funktionieren des neoklassischen Marktmodells zu vergegenwärtigen - vollkommene Information, viele uniforme Marktteilnehmer und eine hohe Anzahl von Transaktionen. Diejenigen Märkte, für welche die im Internet verfügbaren Informationen relevant sind, werden also effizienter - Transaktionen können schneller und zu geringeren Kosten abgewickelt werden und es ist leichter, sich umfassend zu informieren und dadurch bessere Entscheidungen zu treffen. Diese durch das Internet induzierte verbesserte Effizienz der Märkte ist eine der Ursachen sowohl für das Gefühl des Agierens auf Augenhöhe des Netzbürgers untereinander als auch für das Wegbrechen von warmen Nischen, in denen sich Anbieter komfortabel breitgemacht hatten.\nDas Internet ist das Medium, in dem sich Akteure und Informationen tummeln. Freie Software ist das Werkzeug, dass sie zusammenbringt. Ohne sowohl freie als auch kostenlos verfügbare Produktionsmittel würde das Internet nicht annähernd die Akzeptanz und insbesondere die wehrhafte Unterstützung erfahren, die gerade sichtbar wird (siehe ACTA). Durch diese einladende Ausgangssituation werden Internetnutzer gleichzeitig zu Produzenten und Konsumenten. Dieses Prinzip war zu Pionierzeiten noch deutlicher - einer der frühen Kritikpunkte an den heute üblichen asymmetrisch schnellen Internetzugängen war, dass dadurch die dezentrale Peer-to-Peer-Struktur des Internet untergraben wird. Obwohl weniger prominent, wirkt dieses Prinzip aber noch heute, und nicht nur bei Journalismus, Musik und Photographie, wo Nutzer originär an der Erstellung der Produkte beteiligt sind. Auch unterschwelliger sind wir alle Produzenten: in soziale Netzwerken dokumentieren wir die Beziehungen zwischen allen möglichen Aspekten des Lebens (und machen sie dadurch ökonomisch verwertbar, durch wen auch immer), und durch Bewertungen übernehmen wir die Filterung der verfügbaren Daten nach Relevanz und Qualität. Diese Metainformationen sind nicht weniger wichtig wie die ursprünglichen, auf die sie verweisen, was daran deutlich wird, dass die Geschäftsmodelle grosser Unternehmen wie Twitter darauf aufbauen diese zu sammeln. Insgesamt sind nicht nur ausgesprochen niedrige Barrieren zu überwinden, um selbst mit zu produzieren, es wird darüber hinaus aktiv darum geworben - nicht zuletzt, weil der Wert dieser riesigen Datenmengen nicht vorrangig dem Nutzer, sondern den dominanten Datensammlern im Netz zu Gute kommt. Jedenfalls ist das Read/Write Internet das Ergebnis, eine Gemeinschaft, in der die Unterscheidung von Produzent und Konsument schwerer wird und sich deshalb Regulierung nicht mehr so schön mit den jeweils Betroffenen einzeln verkungeln lässt.\nWat dem eenen sin Uhl, is dem anneren sin Nachtigal. Effizientere Märkte bedeuten vor allem mehr Wettbewerb und damit mehr Anpassungsdruck, mehr kreative Zerstörung. Jedes neue Produkt ersetzt ein vorheriges, so das es nicht verwunderlich ist, dass sich all diesen neuen Entwicklungen massiver Widerstand entgegenstellt mit dem Ziel, diese wenn nicht ganz zu verhindern, dann doch anständig zu verlangsamen. Wenn wir heute Filmkritiken aus dem Kinosaal verschicken, schadet das nicht nur dem Umsatz von schlechten Schinken, es bleiben auch Berufskinokritiker auf der Strecke, deren Meinung auf einmal kaum noch einen Kinogänger interessiert. Es geht aber auch ernsthafter - (Mikro-) Blogging aus politischen Krisengebieten ersetzt Vor-Ort-Journalismus und ist gleichzeitig schneller und authentischer. Produktbewertungen durch Kunden konkurrieren um die Deutungshoheit etablierter Produkttester, weshalb sie auch gern manipuliert werden - die Stiftung Warentest fährt dieses Jahr zum ersten Mal einen Verlust ein.

Effectively, users and programmers together were both contributors, they collaborated on the project. Glyn goes on to explain how this community effort changed over time to become more institutionalized, more corporate and more dull - “becoming a ‘Firefox Affiliate’, hardly something that sets the pulse racing.” Ordinary users no longer play an important part in Open Source projects.\nFor Aristotle the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy the citizens can have a share in freedom. Underlying is the assumption that Open Source is democratic, and this assumption needs to be questioned. Open Source communities have been coined to be self-directed, meritocratic, …, but it is rarely emphasized that they are democratic. Since individuals are investing effort in their favorite projects to contribute to something greater, and democracy is commonly considered to be a greater good as well, it is intriguing to make the jump to thinking of Open Source communities as being democratic. But are they? What is the meaning of democracy in the context of Open Source? What does a democratic community look like?\nSome may say that such political concepts cannot easily be transferred to how Open Source communities should function. While it may not be easy, it is still worthwhile - democracies have dealt with similar problems of inclusion and the distribution of power and responsibility. Just like democratic states, communities are volunteer organizations that congregate to build the public goods they desire in the commons. Just like citizens, members of communities have a choice of voice or exit that they make based on the expected influence they have as citizens. There are enough similarities to justify learning by example.\nOn being a contributor Democracy means “rule of the people”, and postulates, amongst other things, for each individual to be equal before the law and to have a vote in the political process and election of the government. This immediately boils down to the central Yin-Yang question of who is a citizen and who is not. Are users considered integral parts (citizens) of the Open Source communities, or outsiders who provide feedback? And should they be the equals of developers? While today we seem to think that equality comes standard, it is in fact a dynamic concept, its meaning changes with culture. Think about the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that finally abolished voter’s discrimination by race in the US, or the fact that women will gain the right to vote in Saudi Arabia in the year 2015. This is what Glyn observes - users changed from being integral elements of the community to playing an only marginal role, akin to not having a vote.\nEligibility and acceptance are what discerns citizens from barbarians and slaves. Eligibility answers the question of which individuals can potentially become citizens. Acceptance is the requirements an eligible individual has to fulfill to gain citizenship. For example, a foreigner living in a country may be eligible for citizenship, but to be accepted needs to pay taxes for a number of years. When the same questions are applied to Open Source communities, they translate to “Who is a contributor and could thus become a citizen of our community? How does somebody join the project?” and second, “What does a newcomer have to do to be considered a contributor, a part of the community?” (does that sound like “How do I become a committer”? - exactly). In Open Source communities usually all individuals are eligible to join, but to be accepted and integrated, they need to contribute to the code.\nSo for users to become integral parts of Open Source communities again, users that engage with an Open Source project need to be equal contributors amongst peers, to be eligible. This is far from standard, and not the mind-set of most contributors I know. Most communities I work with value direct contributions to the project source code higher than feedback from users. They (unconsciously?) consider users outsiders and refer them to talk to the issue tracker, a proven way to make sure they never come back again with more feedback. So firstly, users need to be considered eligible to become community members, and second their efforts (feedback, for example) need to qualify them for acceptance as ordinary contributors.\nOn Open Governance But not all communities are created equal. When evaluating how democratic a community is, we need to look at their reason to exist. Not all Open Source projects are created by developers and users together, and the distribution of power and responsibility usually follows …","date":1346256530,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558006438,"objectID":"f6b1f3ddf4b622e0a2bcbb0cb00969b5","permalink":"https://www.creative-destruction.org/post/2012-is-open-source-democratic/","publishdate":"2012-08-29T18:08:50+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/2012-is-open-source-democratic/","section":"post","summary":"In his recent post, Glyn Moody asks an important question - “Can Open Source be democratic?” He describes how Free Software emerged as a distributed, bottom-up system of writing code. The central defining aspects of that culture are a uniquely open process not just of programming but also of its organization, and a close relationship between programmers and users.","tags":["FOSS","governance"],"title":"Is Open Source democratic?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mirko Boehm"],"categories":null,"content":"Heated discussions are going on in the KDE community in the aftermath of the announcement of Nokia’s platform strategy change. Rationality often goes out of the window when people feel such a change goes against their personal values or beliefs. In the past days, I worked on an analysis of the impact of the changes on KDAB, Qt and the Free Software communities we work with, especially KDE. KDAB is rooted deeply in the KDE community, and many of our developers work with Qt and KDE for years now. We are sharing the same worries and hopes, so the results may be interesting for others as well. This post is about Qt, KDE, Free Software, politics, devices, markets, strategies - it does not get much better than that. Read on.\nBe thankful for what you got We are told to judge by actions, not by words, so let us have a look at the development of Qt since Nokia bought Trolltech, and how the KDE community benefitted from it. It is important to stress this up front because it is easy to forget that since then, Nokia has been a very important benefactor. KDE is based on Qt and always relied heavily it’s technical advances. Trolltech convinced many developers to use Qt because of it’s superior quality and ease of use and the friendly and inspiring developer community. But it was a small company, and could not have afforded to forgo the license revenue made from selling commercial Qt licenses. This revenue was the central pillar of Trolltech’s business model. Trolltech was also in the uneasy situation that it influenced the software industry way more than it’s small size warranted, and attracted the attention of much larger competitors. With the takeover, the revenue Trolltech generated was to a large extend irrelevant to Nokia. The development framework is a strategic asset, and selling Qt licenses is not in line with Nokia’s core competencies. It also made perfect business sense to invest even more resources that could never have been afforded from the license revenue, to be able to rely on Qt as the future UI platform. This investment resulted in huge performance improvements, new technologies like QML, a continuous stable development process with many releases, Qt Creator, and many other goodies.\nBut the biggest gift Nokia ever presented us with was to relicense Qt under the LGPL. It finally overcame the acceptance issue with Qt in the wider Free Software space, and helped grow the Qt user base massively. While other important safeguards like the Free Qt Foundation were already in place, using Qt under the LGPL license is so much less of a hurdle to take then to enforce the rights granted through the Free Qt Foundation. Those rights can also only be executed once, and only as an action of last resort. Without Qt under LGPL, MeeGo would not have been accepted by the software industry. This, the public hosting of the Qt git repo and the massive development manpower Nokia invested in Qt benefit KDE immensely.\nThe best part is that none of these presents can be un-given or taken away. Qt is there to stay under the current Free Software licenses, and the quality it gained in the recent years will also remain at KDE’s service. There are new developments in KDE like QML and QtQuick that KDE still has to fully make use of. Today’s Qt is a superb platform to base the development of KDE on in the coming years. Thanks, Nokia.\nQt It is an open question how these past achievements translate into the future when it comes to Qt’s own development. From talking to business partners and contacts at Nokia, it is pretty clear that no new direction has been set for the Qt unit at Nokia. The announcement that there will be no layoffs or budget cuts is comforting, but it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It may have all kinds of reasons, for example personnel retention, local labor laws, maintaining an undamaged business unit that can be sold - or the simple lack of an updated strategy. So all these statements have to be mentally extended with an “…until further notice”. By definition, strategy changes do not occur on a regular basis. Even if the Microsoft partnership is unsuccessful (in sales figures, for example), it will take 3 to 5 years for that to be realized and the strategy to be re-evaluated. In that time frame, there will most certainly be changes to the Qt unit if it remains within Nokia.\nChecking the facts about Nokia platforms shipping Qt Nokia plans to ship another 150 million Symbian devices with Qt installed. The ability to do so depends heavily on the appeal of these phones to users willing to pay more than the magical 100 Euro barrier price. A vivid app market is necessary to reach this goal, since apps are a major sales driver in today’s smartphones. Will companies keep investing in the fledgling Symbian plus Qt app space? Investors shy away from shrinking markets. Every corporate strategist tasked with developing a product-market-matrix will put anything Symbian related into the “de-invest” bracket.
